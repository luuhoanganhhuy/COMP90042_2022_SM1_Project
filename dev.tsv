How does COVID-19 spread? People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.It's a Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A.What is a coronavirus? Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS.The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19.Should I worry about COVID-19? Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized.Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.Should I wear a mask to protect myself? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.The mask can only be used once.If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? No. There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.Is there anything I should not do? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:1. Smoking2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 3. Wearing multiple masks 4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.CoronaAlert coronavirus CoronaOutbreakThread	0

How can you find goodness in the slaughter of innocents? God's goodness can't be simply a result of God's power. So what do these stories mean? If they aren't true in some regard, why would they exist in the Christian scriptures, unless those scriptures aren't true?I am having real trouble reconciling all of this with my faith. I don't see love here. I don't see it anywhere in these stories. I don't think I'd have been able to return to Christianity if I'd grown up believing they were true.What did Jesus think when he reflected on the punishment suffered by the families of Korah, Atham, and Abiram? Check out Peter Enns’ work. He’s got a great book The Bible Tells Me So: why defending scripture has made us unable to read it. Very helpful for navigating through today’s questions in a book written long ago.	0

"Can new audio help the Michael Brown investigation?

No. Let me know if you have any other questions for me.  do wanna help the investigation or your ratings? Cnn put up that Michael Brown video.

Always bare in mind,cops will always protect other cops,it's a brotherhood wether anyone wants to acknowledge it or not how come all we gear about is the black person shit by a white cop. But not the white kid shot by a black cop. Happened same time A person hears gunshots and doesn't pause speaking? A person doesn't hear the gunshots at first but does later (much later)? Hard sell. ferguson michaelbrown big dummy - let's just loot our own neighborhood AGAIN &amp; burn some mo shit up yo !  with how far advanced our technology is a audio recording could easily be faked/tampered.

People on my facebook saying this is all an overreaction that the media is pushing and COVID-19 is just like the flu. WTF do you think would happen to the country if we all got the flu at once?!?To clarify of course I am not saying it is like the flu, I am saying even if someone thought that. ITS STILL BAD! Except this has 10-60 times higher death rate. (60 times in Italy, where it's 6%, 4% | 40 times in Wuhan.) Well it isn’t just like the flu bc we don’t have a vaccine.

Dear Mr. Chomsky, I'd like to confirm that this analysis spread by ""alternative"" media like telesur, hispantv is really yours and reflect.

Pennsylvania is now one of states NOT increasing the COVID cases by 2,000 3,000 a day.  icanwearamask. My ancestors couldn't in the coal mines, WWII bombings, but I can do it for them. Really, how hard is it ?  There is no anti-wearing a mask argument.   Are you a doctor? You’re the sheeple with that Fox News spew. Flattening the curve was to keep the hospitals from being overran. If you want to hurry along the herd immunity, go to Florida and roll the dice. Until then wear a fucking mask and do your part.   No, not a doctor, I have just listened to countless doctors make the same claim...including Dr. Fauci himself.  You’re blind and need to do some research outside of mainstream media.  Masks do NOTHING and I will not wear one.  Learn to think for yourself.	0

According to WHO:Drinking methanol, ethanol or bleach DOES NOT prevent or cure COVID-19 and can be extremely dangerousMethanol, ethanol, and bleach are poisons. Drinking them can lead to disability and death.Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces – however you should never drink them. They will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs.To protect yourself against COVID-19, disinfect objects and surfaces, especially the ones you touch regularly. You can use diluted bleach or alcohol for that. Make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.covid19 awareness covid19awareness stayhome staysafe 	0

"  Is COVID-19 airborne? I heard Fauci say there's a mild ""aerosol effect,"" limited to where droplets from a cough/sneeze linger in the air, moving a minor amount before dissipating. If it *is* airborne, it's concerning, but I wonder if this is more singing/yelling in a closed room.   Yeah, 2.5 hours in a room of 60 people doing the musical equivalent of coughing, getting Purell after opening the door, 2.5 hours of potty breaks (more door handles), and--with no one coughing--I doubt they were very scrupulous about distancing.   Nope! When you speak/sing there are a lot of droplets in the air! They don’t fall. They hang for hours   Well, there goes my hope of ever going to karaoke night again.   I was seeing 0.5% possible vector for total cases. If it is it's not much in this manner thank goodness.   No, they were all singing energetically in a closed room. The virus spreads via aerosol. Whether that's from coughing or making loud mouth noises doesn't make a difference. They were being incredibly reckless.   I swear some people think ""no touching"" means the virus can only be spread by coughing in your hand and then rubbing it in your face."	0

END times are coming and they're coming fast. were is the out rage of the parents if they were my kids I would pull them out asap and home school them  Heads need to roll? That's Biblical! Very punny!  It COULD be a practical preparation for our future so maybe kudos are in order?  unbelievable, is it true? How praising any god might be forced especially into children? _MooreW4, If Christianity is not allowed,  neither should Islam be.  Coming soon, to a school near you. _Ammo This so wrong people.

I'll die for my faith before this happens.  i think you were a Christian nation....(non offending)  Did parents even know until after the fact?   If its happening in the  USA you can bet CAMMY will allow it in UK  If one religion is shown to a child all should be. And I mean all of them. Let them see the truth. Not Taqiyya.   Soon  these asshole will be the ones missing heads...this is so UN AMERICAN to force this on our kids.Don't Smoke Hope RT :  | why is anyone surprised? Socialist POTUS IS Muslim!!! That's Islam!!

Do they have them say the sinner ' s prayer for the Christian part of world history!  Of course not  oh  hell no Okay, if muslims want to fight, they'll get a fight! one they'll regret!  Parents need to throw that school up for grabs.. If ever there was a need to take a stand, this is it. I'm convinced they're indoctrinating children to worship an anti-Christ..  It appears to only be State sponsored religion if they are made to recite Christian prayers.  What would happen if muslims were forced to pray as Christians, attend Catholic Mass, communion???????  no way   This cannot be true -This is America &amp; this nonsense has to STOP.          Maybe Trump could deport the 4 million Ragheads along with the 11 million illegals! :) It's to bad rolled heads isn't real! Then folks might think twice before teaching about islam to kids.

If a few kids disappear Harry and the Dems can really push the blame knife deep it does not get any lower than this.

Thank your friends and you know you don't really care so if Amber alerts get shutdown during govt shutdown &amp; ocare gets implemented, would ocare shutdown in next gov shutdown? That will qualify as a new low, but also a wake up call of why Govmtn should be restrained.. I wonder if the bot will get retroactive pay when the app is turned back on. HarryReidsShutdown  DemocratShutdown  he should be on Mt Douchemore, which is closed due the shutdown.  Gee, it’s almost as if the government actually DOES stuff when it’s operational. I'm sure the message capability that all cell phones have to have now, allowing Prez to send msg to all cells is still wkng. How can this possible? What is going on? I'm seriously getting nervous over the country? What levels is willing to go? it's unbelievablert  Really? Amber Alert website goes dark under government shutdown  /YES REALLY MICHELLE P2 that is real low REALLY?  Is there anyone left that doesn't see this Tyrant for what he is????  ImpeachObama what if it was one of his children!~ OMG i am PISSED! We do not have a Dictator! // tipping point?  Or does a child have to actually die? Here's a link for ya.  can we say Desperate!? and S-A-D! and yet they van pay guys to guard concrete and marble monuments... Obama is showing us the power he has.This is very scary and big gov people should beware and worried too.  not really. Just the DoJ website explaining how system works is down. he disgusts me. so I no he can't be impeached yet, but at what point can he? Or cause the senate wont agree to, we live with him till 2014 as a father, how is this not priority number one. Am I living in America or somewhere else?? Michelle you obviously hate Government.   You need to get a hobby. par for the course Yet Obama and family are still in residence on fed property with electricity, TV, computers etc. Elitist Dem slobs.  Wanna bet the Silver Alert still works?  he's tougher on us than real terrorists Obama and all his liberal worshipers are a bad joke! How low can this (they) go?   Well, heck.  We're from the Government and we've got our priorities.  Eating your vegetables is important."	1

"Remember: Seasonal flu is *very different* to pandemic flu.If someone says ""Covid-19 is just like the flu"", check which one they're talking about.If they mean ""seasonal flu"", take what they say with a bucketload of salt.1918 Spanish flu: One of the worst pandemics in history, killed up to 50 million people1957 Asian flu: Killed at least a million1968 Hong Kong flu: Killed at least a million1977 Russian flu: Less than a million deaths2009 swine flu: Killed several hundred thousandOne of those five pandemics, the Russian flu, appears to have been just an old defrosted flu strain from a laboratory. People alive in the 1950s were immune, and the virus was weirdly similar to earlier ones. So really we're down to four truly novel pandemics.Anyone reading this has almost certainly lived through a pandemic, the H1N1 swine flu in 2009, but we were lucky there that it was extremely mild with a fatality rate not much different to seasonal flu.Fatality rates often fall as an epidemic spreads but it would be unwise to assume that case fatality in every pandemic will fall to swine flu levels. All the evidence so far suggests Covid-19 mortality is higher, by at least an order of magnitude. So don't panic but please don't be complacent.Lots of tech/finance types are still talking about this as if it's no big deal.Virologists and epidemiologists are taking it far more seriously.  Hoy did all those pandemic go away? Herd immunity gradually built up to the point it wasn't able to spread easily, and under this selective pressure the virus evolved to different and less fatal strainsAs the name implies, seasonal flu goes round the world every year. We have high rates of immunity to it because many of us have been exposed before, and we even have vaccines to prevent it.Pandemic flu happens just a few times in every century and is much more alarming.

"The Vatican insists Pope Francis’ encounter with Kim Davis was not endorsement of her views    now we are FlipFlopping KimDavis any comments  So then the Pope is on board with gay marriage?  It smells like shit. It looks like shit ... but it is cheese? Kim Davis is a tool for the ultra right wing of the bigot party.  BFFs?  / the nyslimes. Cant wait when you go out business. Eu não caio na graça desse papa Francisco...acredito eu que ele não seja o que diz ser.😒  the Pope should declare that, not anyone else please,  don't speculate Did Pop hear about Nuba Mountains People's problems then why he keep silent    so, now..even the Vicar of Christ is capable of Lies!    whether you agree with Kim Davis or not, this has to be a big ""OOPS"" moment for the Pope. Busted  That's pity. Because she was right.  Kim Davis is a news hound she lives to see herself in the news very boring woman  The Pope approves gay marriages ?? Lost in freedom of speech. Let me take your hand.   not what she heard then condemn her and her intolerance for God's children. Gay or not isn't it the Christians duty to be kind, even to ""sinners'?  The Pope just lost my vote!  I call bullshit.  why didn't this come out sooner while he was here. He had no business visiting with her.  The Holy Vicar of the Catholic Church shouldn't  have visited  with Ms. Davis, no matter what church say  Big Poppa Poppin USCan't believe media et al is boxing a Pope into a corner like this!    has the Vatican ever done anything that didn't sit quite right?  She just happened to show up while 330M wernt invited  Maybe it was to read her her ""Last Rights""  sure seemed like it!! I was very disappointed, thought everyone was created equal!! 😡😡  Davis pursues her gravy train and wishes to ride Pope's coat tails at popular visit. Remember fake photo? aka Too bad .  does not considered as Kim Davis a religious person lol.  yaaaaay, who cares"	0

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?LetsFightCorona People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.LetsFightCorona These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. LetsFightCorona Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.LetsFightCorona People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.LetsFightCorona This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.LetsFightCorona WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    LetsFightCorona Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?LetsFightCorona Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”LetsFightCorona The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.LetsFightCorona The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.LetsFightCorona 	0

Q1.) What is Covid-19 and where did it originate? ScaredTooA1.) The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a beta corona virus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. Early on , many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animalMarket, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.

"Vatican says KimDavis' meeting w/ PopeFrancis 'should not be considered a form of support.'   surelookslikeit her supporters had the contacts with papal hierarchy to get this set up - those supporters keeping it in the news I'll believe that when PopeFrancis meets with leaders of the lgbt community The Pope sent a clear message by meeting with KimDavis why are either of these idiots getting any coverage why the hell not It is perplexing, read an article yesterday, that said Pope was unaware, something to do with vatican politics.  I dont understand all this nut hugging for the pope anyway. He is a sham and a douche... same as all of them. Not what she is claiming_keroftruth101 takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be Kim Davis makes my skin crawl! ask POTUS why does Chicago his home town has very strict gun laws &amp; very high gun violence?       1 of the great things about this pope is he doesn't care about appearances. Maybe he was modeling peace &amp; forgiveness thank GOD Well, she's a very lucky person to have met him. Of course it's a form of support! It just shouldn't have any impact on our political policies.  He supported the death row inmate too  she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position. its a small town so go figure KanyeShrug hope he gave her a WTF about being divorced 3 times. Many people ""meet"" with a Pope. Apparently this was a blessing in DC. He probably never heard of her then Wham! He's in a storm. all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth  too late! What other reason would the Pope have for a private meeting (she's not even Catholic) The face of mental illness being made famous.  ((saw your status on Facebook the other day))  yes just like people do for imagrents. then what should it be considered? Unless he performed an exorcism on that witch, it will be considered support. getreal A church desperate to look cool is a sad thing She just needs to go away KimDavis should have kept this meeting private bet that's what Pope wanted shes using it to glorify/publicize herself more Shameless The Vatican is has given in. SMH. KimDavis has More guts and stronger in her faith Than the Vatican and it Pope. PopeFrancis is a bullshitter What is it then? Does Catholic church support homosexuality? Does it conduct gay marriages? So what was it then?Trying to help the sinner stop homophobing?A strategy session?Swapping culture war stories?An affair? don't tell me that the Vatican us telling a lie it's definitely support. But the Pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse. So who really cares. Then exactly how should the meeting be considered?  shouldn't have met with KimDavis to begin with. Rewarded bad behavior. .  Nor forgiveness... So what is it? With God there is no sitting on the wall With that meeting, the Pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was.  buy this album if you love the pope _bel Terrible to follow Catholic doctrine by a pope, seriously ? Who ya gonna believe - me or the pope? They lyin! gaykentucky refreekimdavis Most assuredly not! Ms. Davis has a true commitment to God and His Word. The Pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and $$. Too late for this...  I stand with you Kim..God be with you. ~ did he spank her ? so if all the military and police who protected him on his US  visit refused to do their job  based on religious beliefs is that ok? you support or you don't, sorry, too many on the fence, it broke.With how many of God's gay children did  meet? In secret or public? Whether supportive or not?  the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind, find a solution to Oregon like issues important point is that he met with her and not gay groups. Gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage. 😒  so I assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage? Millions of Catholics wait a Lifetime to share a moment with a Pope.Why Her?Because the Pope is a Socialist who knows Propaganda!  Maybe not but the Pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from France to the Vatican.Says much popeturd is back tracking already... The PC police flexing their muscle again... Disgusting; and people still worship this false idol.  Why would he meet with her anyway? You lost me, off my list! Simply stop talking about her Funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be...   he met with a gay couple the day before Kim Davis then he shouldn't have met with her!! Doesn't matter why or what was said. She will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia. Just like they do with abortion issue no it should not! The Vatican is hedging its bets in case she goes full psycho. (She's halfway there.) Pope met w/her in support of her religious liberty &amp; conscience to put God's law above constitution, which he made clear his position. He too (Pope) will stand before God. But won't be left standing. Repent of thy ways &amp; turn to God &amp; His Ways. KimDavis -be encouraged That is a lie and the Vatican didn't say that. Homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians. kimdavis Pope Francis may have spoke against Jesus Christ but he is not stupid enough to take a STAND on NONSENSE by the Kentucky Clerk then how should we consider it? A show of...??? 1)Kim Davies is1 of d most courageous human I know.ALONE,she stood PUBLICALLY to defend God's guide for Mankind's progress&amp;evolution. that's right people! Somebody needs to tell this lady to stop judging! That's a sin! crazylady  Read the rest of the sentence, not support for ALL of what she is doing. They qualified it. Meaning they support some of it_Abe  He is a holy man giving comfort. I bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do I really have to talk to her but what I heard on news..it seems it was a form of support..it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b.s_Abe  exactly.  She should follow the Patriots mantra, ""Do your job"". well thank God she met the Pop though it's Sad the Vatican knows what the Bible says n still don't provide support for Kim! Sad sad!"	0

First, how does COVID_19 spread?1. The virus can spread to people who are within about 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 when that person coughs or sneezes.2. The virus can spread through direct contact with their saliva or mucusTips for sex during COVID  3: Time to cut out casual hookups. Sexing folks you don't know very well can be super risky at this point because The ‘Rona spreads real easy. (Block that homie who stay sliding into the DMs, issa no for low key low down loving). Tips for sex during COVID  4: Contact is high risk give in-person dates a miss. Video dates, sexting &amp; sending nudes or other digital spaces are the way forward. (Try throwing in some web based sex toys too). Tips for sex during COVID  5: Kissing can pass COVID-19 so avoid kissing those who do not form part of the squad e.g. your close circle. Being close makes it easier to track who has got what so thats who you can put (both sets of) lips onTips for sex during COVID  6: Rimming can also spread the virus 'cause the virus has been found to be present in feces, so chill on eating ass for awhile. (You can do it honey). Tips for sex during COVID  7: Now more than ever is the time to keep your sex squeaky clean. Wash your hands, cut your nails, scrub your body and keep your sex toys spotless.  Keep that soap and water close by. Tips for sex during COVID  8: If your partner(s) seems like they are looking/feeling ill, skip the sex. Same thing if you start to feel unwell.Tips for sex during COVID  9: If either you or your partner(s) having condtions that could make COVID-19 even more intense (e.g. lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer or a weakened immune system) skip the sex.Tips for sex during COVID  10: Keep talking. This time can be tricky, being 'stuck' together can cause some tension. Make sure you keep calm and keep chatting about any frustrations. When it comes to COVID and sex there is still lots and lots to learn, but from what info we have the general idea is skip the sex unless it is:a. You. b. someone in your close inner circle/partner (aka someone who you staying knowing their movements and status)Tips for sex during COVID  11: Check in on people because self isolation can be difficult for some. Just 'cause you can't rub up on each other doesn't mean you shouldn't care. We love you and want you to come out on the other side of this thing healthy and happy.

    great, what is the timeframe for widely available vaccines so we can reach herd immunity before 1M people die? or 2M?From : Four COVID19 vaccines have reported neutralizing antibody titers from immunized non-human primates.  had at least an order of magnitude higher titers; but differences in the trial designs can make direct comparisons difficult.     and this is progress? makes a vaccine seem really far off!    Novavax will release their Phase 1 trial results on 130 humans in July. They are using a well established protocol of making a pre-fusion Covid spike protein through expression of recombinant insect cells and an adjuvant that enhances immune response.    At risk they’re mass producing 100 M doses for December &amp; have secured resources to make a billion doses in 2021    we'll be well past 1M deaths at that rate. maybe 1M just in the USA by then with all this slack government response.	0

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at d early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing researchHOW LIKELY AM I TO CATCH THE COVID 19The risk depends on where you  are - and more ,whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreadingCOVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. There is daily updates on the situation	0

  “The flu is a much bigger threat than coronavirus, for now.” This was written before the US had any confirmed cases. And there is a difference between stating that the flu is a bigger threat and claiming Covid-19 is just like the flu (despite having a mortality rate 30x the flu).Analysis: Misunderstanding the math, Trump embraced a coronavirus death toll we’ll soon surpass   So I take it you are glad Trump took measures even before this article came out? Or are you one of the people who thinks Trump acted too late? If so, then WaPo should have known at the time this article came out.  Are you referring to the incomplete ban on travel from China, which didn’t prevent the virus from coming to America, that was issued two days before this article?	1

"1.15 million Americans have been killed by guns since John Lennon's death  _is_risen   Do they use guns for that? moron  surely a typo there....? John -  the staggeringly stupid comments re: fetuses, President Obama, gun defense are from small s of the disturbed. Oh man...we need you and your songs today more than ever! You will be forever missed.  - About same  of abortions performed in 1980 alone. Since 1980 there have been over 23 million babies killed  at least triple that number for the amount of lives lost to drunk driving since then    thanks we will try in london.  how many by OD?  Ban guns, they'll just smuggle them through Mexico. How many guns stopped a crime in progress  1.15 million? How come?  but how many have been killed by cars since then? they're all nutters guns were made just to kill things it ain't good at all well I assume the author meant that 1.5 million people have  been killed by other people. Cause guns  don't kill ppl, ppl do  well this is some random shit!!!  No weapons that kill, it is the man that kills!

You mean by fellow Americans -- not foreign terrorists, right? NotetoTrump  Yeah man its all Lennons fault!  Not so hot on animals, however- Yoko had a room full of fur coats. Stop. And Imagine JohnLennon  via   Ultimate hipster move. Getting shot before everyone else.  Jesus H. Christ. 1.15 million people? Who are we?  you mean killed by people. Why shift the blame? He was awesome. One of the people I would to speak to, if I could.  Seriously? Knew it was an insane number, but that is just staggering. They're living in a war zone.  60% of those numbers are suicides...  song Then that`s 1.15 million and 1 too many then.  can you imagine how many were killed before his death Way to go terrorists... n a lot more before him. * &amp; @ @ @ John Lennon Forever ! ! !  @ @ @ &gt; &gt; &gt; ...  that puts things into perspective.  just a number.

Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.

"   '...the World Health Organization insists “the new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.”“To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes,” the WHO reports.' This would make grocery shopping a pretty serious issue.We've been told that social distancing is what was needed. If these studies are true, then we'd need much more isolation. For what it's worth, I certainly hope that this airborne transmission is disproven. Fingers crossed. It would also make the use of masks mandatory for everyone, BTW which is something the CDC has been very reluctant to propose. The question I have is why COVID-19 is less transmissible than Measles if it is actually an airborne transmitted disease? The size of respiratory particles for coronavirus is thought to be larger than for measles, so it was thought to spread less readily. This latest research suggests that these prior assumptions are NOT correct and that COVID19 can spread MUCH more easily than previous guidance.   I thought that article was pretty clear, but here's another one just in case.  I'll also clearly say ""There is NO EVIDENCE that mosquitos can spread the coronavirus"", in the same light that there's no evidence my penis can shoot laser beams."	0

      So there’s nothing on the WHO site advising healthy people to not wear masks in public, except that masks shouldn’t be worn while exercising and social distancing should be observed.

"  Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets yes but what is covid 19 and how does IT get transmitted?This is what a real expert's answer looks like;  Hi Charlotte.

The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.Pls Don't panic people with fake news because it's not real All Facts are in these threads 	0
Q. Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?A. Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods &amp; the risk of catching the virus from a package that has been exposed to different conditions &amp; temperature is very low.Q. How long does the virus survive on surfaces?A. [1/2] Preliminary studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days but this may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).[2/2] If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. CoronavirusReachesDelhi	0
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?Older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

No, they're not and will never be the same. The fact that the two exercise will involve people being in queue doesn't mean we can't conduct election in Dec if situation remain same. Our election is just a day event.         Does it take 100 days to be infected by somebody who has the virus? Certainly no cos as far as I know it can take a day. So your point is flawed         How many times do u have to be educated on the reasons. Or is it that u don't read to understand?	0

"    Because covid-19 is just like the flu?You are proving the point of the tweet, every time you reply like this:""Obama good! Orangeman bad!""   Looks like Steve, in his hope &amp; change, anti-trump rage, couldn't spend 5 minutes to look up the facts. That's soooo unusual for reactionary progressives.     Funny how that works. H1N1 has killed ~13k people in the span of one year in the US alone.Covid 19 has killed ~42k people in the span of 4 months.    Funny how many people on the left are justifying Obama's numbers and giving him a pass...     Funny. Is Obama currently president? Did the GOP during H1N1 give him a pass? (the answer to both is no btw) ~13k in a year or 40k in 4 months is a small difference, ya know? You are very funny    No. Covid 19 is not like the flu.And yes. Obama was objectively better than the orange man. But keep licking the trump boot."	1

"We know they're shallow. We know they are frivolous. The first description of the Rich mom is that she's ""simple."" It's part of the hook, part of the reason why everything happens.So why do we need it reiterated with this played out stereotype?It just doesn't quite fit.I hesitate to say there's such a thing as a perfect film, but having just watched Parasite for the first time, it hits pretty damn fucking close.I'm genuinely trying to think of things that bugged me. The one that struck me the most was how, yet again, we have a thriller type film like Us where we have to include Native Americans somehow. It's beyond played out at this point &amp; I wish they'd gone with something else.Bong Joon-ho clearly trusts his audience. Having just seen Train to Busan last year, his development from even then to now is clear. He doesn't bother with excess. And Parasite is so well trimmed.But here we have just a little fat, a chewy piece on an otherwise perfect steak.And what would've made the film even closer to perfect was if some people who saw it weren't alienated by his inclusion of that trope.I remember the discourse. Stuff like that hurts folk. I remember it with Us too.And that's really the only thing bad about Parasite.It rightfully joins the ranks of Annihilation, Mad Max: Fury Road, No Country For Old Men, Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, There Will Be Blood, and Us as ""Films Riley Will Keep Thinking About For Years.""It's deserving. They all are almost perfect. And I really will keep thinking. I've wanted to see that one but I hear it has ghosts. i think that's part of the intent, but also it's to show how Western values have been forced into Korean society. the rich family identifies with Americans and blindly reproduces the harm the US has caused.should be clear, i don't think that excuses it, you're right that it's a tired and harmful depiction, but i think even if it could have been handled a lot better it was going for something deeper than just reinforcing how they're out of touch. They are obsessed with American culture and the way that comes out is the son obsessed with cowboys and Indians from our Westerns. They don't consider the cultural implications at all bc they're so far removed from it geographically and economically."	0

  Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.I’m an older (57yr) RN. I lived through H1N1 &amp; Avian flu. In hospital, clinic &amp; public health units we were over prepared. Speaking out National Nurses United has stated alarm for our nurses. I am stunned by disregard &amp; unpreparedness of this administration  for coronavirus. I’m very worried about healthcare workers amidst this chaos. I have a question for you. Would a viral pneumonia vaccination minimize the risks for coronavirus turning into a secondary respiratory problem? And would it prevent elder caregivers from passing it on to residents? I believe in vaccination and you have brought up a really important complication of any flu. I think both flu &amp; pneumonia vaccine should not be overlooked.

In 50 years antivaxxers will say how COVID-19 is just like the flu, not that bad, better to get it and have natural immunity to it because the complications are SO rare. They'll argue that the death rates went down in 2020 due to better hand washing and not because of social 1/2distancing or a vaccine. They'll say the millions of deaths were from other vaccines, or bad Chinese food habits. They'll say Big Pharma created this whole mess to make money. They'll repeat history again and again. 2/2FlattenTheCurve coronavirus COVID19 VaccinesWork	1

 Where are the scientists and doctors to set the story straight. Of course absolute numbers are going up as testing increases. And that’s helping herd immunity. What is most important though is cases requiring vents and fatalities, this is going down. WTF???Covid deaths per day in America are down around 80% from their peak in April but we are supposed to forget that, read all the breathless headlines about “record new cases” and panic The other option is to take a deep breath, live in reality, and see the politics at work here  They’re being ignored. I can’t think of a single time Fauci has been quoted accurately.  % positive climbing very high has nothing to do with testing. Also I wish people understood the lag. Get sick - test positive - hospitalization- ICU - intubation - death (unfortunately). We are talking about a month + timeline.   Stop it / the mortality rate is less than 1% and less then 0.5% for those not at risk.   Protect those at risk and the rest of us can get on with life	0

4) The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.5) Hand dryers are NOT effective in killing it.6) UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. 7) Thermal scanners are effective in detecting fever but CANNOT detect people w/ coronavirus who are infected but not yet sick with fever. 8) Spraying alcohol/chlorine all over your body will NOT kill viruses that have already ENTERED your body. 9) There is NO evidence yet that companion animals/pets can be infected w/ covid19. But always wash your hands w/ soap and water after contact with pets to protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli &amp; Salmonella 10) Vaccines against pneumonia &amp; Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) do not provide protection against 2019-nCoV but are still highly RECOMMENDED to protect your health.11) There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection. 12) Eating garlic does NOT help prevent infection w/ the virus.13) People of ALL ages can be infected by 2019-nCoV. OLDER people &amp; w/ pre-existing medical conditions (asthma, diabetes, ❤️ disease etc) may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill. 14) Antibiotics do not work against viruses. But if you’re hospitalized, you may receive antibiotics if there’s bacterial co-infection.15) To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV. However, those infected should receive appropriate care. 	0

How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. (1/3) These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. (2/3)People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. (3/3)e: covid19.ac.zat: 0800 029 999ukzncovid19	0
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.For more information, please contact us. ✨E-mail: info.combgghealthcare health healthy healthylifestyle healthcare coronavirus Coronaturkey COVID19	0
17. You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life. 13. Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus. 14. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates 15. Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous 16. Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or any other lung disease. 18.

4. COVID-19 is just like the fluSARS-CoV-2 definitely has flu like symptoms- aches, fever, and cough. both COVID-19 and flu can also lead to pneumonia. However, COVID-19 is more dangerous with  with a mortality rate between 1% and 3%,10-50 times greater than the seasonal flu2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at riskSARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.5. Everyone with COVID-19 diesThis statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. In fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirusCurrently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus7. Face masks protect against coronavirusDisposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.8. Hand dryers kill coronavirusHand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldAll Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.10. Antibiotics kill coronavirusAntibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusThermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonsCOVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray. Shambho Mahadeva🙏      _kala59  _jr _IR _tinku _monk  Very nice thread insect	1

  In other words, devs have the knowledge they need to make changes therefore why do we need it? To make a fuss about it? Killers already send hateful messages (including death threats even!) to survivors they SUSPECT to be swf, the community cant handle that info in short.I was asked today to do this so I'll just make a poll. Would you guys like a UI added for end game score screen which shows if you were against a SWF? Be it a 2 man, 2, 2 man, 3 man or a 4 man? I feel this would give us more data and less speculation and patterns could form. realistically, what will it prove? sure, you can gain data on swf matches versus solo but you will never know which matches those are until theyre over so would it really matter? what knowledge would be gained that isnt already known? and what would be gained from said knowledge? Every match with 4 man swf has a high probability of x. Every match with double swf has x probability...etc i understand that but you dont know if it's swf before a match so said knowledge wouldnt make a difference within it. beforehand, it would just be speculation therefore how would it be useful? you'd still be playing a match and getting data as you play. 1/2 2/2 is said data to be used to nerf swf somehow? to prove what we already know, swf is powerful? to cast blame on a loss from? because that is how people would abuse this information. not to mention the additional abuse players would get for playing swf.  Hey 😁Devs have all the data they want. Showing some extra intel to killers would suddenly decide them to act on SWF ?Also, I do not get how this data could be abused ?   Simply put, it gives the killer peace of mind knowing that they lost due to something out of their control.   It would, yes. But you have to consider the community as a whole.

our best” and yet the results aren’t up to your standards. Sorry babe. You expect more than this? Yeah we do too. But the thing is this has been the best results in all four years. Let us fucking celebrate when we can and feel good once in a while. And let me tell you, most ofGod I’m so annoyed. Tl look away, I just want to get this off my chest. WE KNOW OK?? We KNOW the results we have right now is not enough to get a comfortable win, that’s why we’re working as hard as we can, double time to catch up. I know it’s fucking stupid to say “we’re doingthe time some of us feel we don’t deserve to celebrate because we’ve not done enough to contribute to that good result. Instead of demanding for better effort, encourage your FELLOW fans. Cheer those that are doing something Motivate them postively, not fucking piss them offbecause you don’t see the results you expect. Not all of us tweet how much we stream or keep the views moving. The same way I won’t ask you what you’re doing to help. I genuinely hope the next comeback of whichever unit you care for does great and be more successful than ever	0
  Sentences like „Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?“ make the website look like scam.

🚨 BREAKING 🚨A tiger has TESTED POSITIVE for COVID-19 in New York!Any thoughts on how this happened?1) Is COVID-19 airborne?2) Is this a case of human to animal transmission?3) Is this a false-positive result?4) Is this due to 5G? 🤔5) Other? 2, it's also transmitted to pets: cats, dogs. New research shows it's also transmitted among pets. 5. Other - Feline covid19 that’s already around the world _Contrarian 1) yes as droplets and aerosol.2) seems lively, need to analyse gene sequence3) it could be4) really?! 5G? No. David Icke did a good job explaining 4. Definitely them with their 5G!  There are other corona viruses that animals are more prone to getting, so I’m skeptical about it being covid19.  Maybe it is something that we all have from being sprayed 24/7 by who knows what. Maybe test the random squirrel or possum or rabbit. Maybe the entire planet has been exposed--except for the super rich. Somehow they have been spared. Hmmmm.  6. Is the brave person who did the nasal swipe still alive and has both hands?  false positive like most tests... Just an extension of the fear narrative, we actually already have the Virus in us in different forms , you could also test a Monkey and they would more than likely test positive , it affirms its just a virus , that's assuming everything you read is the unvarnished truth 🤔 COVID-19 is probably a humanvirus that transmitted to animals, mutated and transferred back to humans. The virus RNA is probably compatible with animal DNA as well as human. Out of curiosity - what is proposed link between ~mm 5G waves and ~10nm viral particles? Food or water contaminated. Or airborne aerosols. Wait...so a Tiger can be tested for COVID-19, but an ordinary citizen has to be near their death bed or have symptoms and prove they were in touch with someone who is already confirmed positive before they can have the test? Have a look through this for some logical and reasonable explanations regarding the pandemic. Fake news is my guess Who would have the faintest idea what the false positive rate would be for the tiger species?The Reverend Bayes would suggest false positive is most likely.   I don’t wanna think abt what happened  Why are we using tests on tigers? 🤔 This story was later disproved as a hoax.Really, John - have you been locked up for too long? It’s 3G taking its revenge on 5G Bullshit, most likely. Bloody tiger f♡ckers! ... seriously though, cats groom a lot so my guess would be infected zoo handler breathing/coughing it onto an animal then big cat licking it off their fur coat.	0

With AZ posting a 33.5% pct-positives today, we know that SitRep data is a load of horse shit from many states now. It is disheartening to be lied to so blatantly.This chart ends at the end of month with a 4.0% pct-pos shop production benchmark (not real infection rate).  You are counting serology tests in the denominator and PCR tests in the numerator. And are not tracking daily new PCR tests. Which means, it is not your fault (I should have said this first) - Arizona is purposely making the numbers appear worse by how they present them, and what they withhold. The Covid Tracking Project and my method, fix this deception.  PCR = active infection, serology = antibody positive	0
     What is the advantage of the herd immunity scenerio? Most of Europe &amp; Asia is gradually returning to normal, but Swedes are mostly banned from travel because so many of them carry a deadly disease. Their strategy is terrible for their health &amp; terrible for their economy.See how quickly you can find Sweden on this map....    It will take a few years to get close to herd immunity.    No one knows if herd immunity can be obtained with this virus. Scientists worry immunity may only last a few months. It may behave more like the coronaviruses that cause the common cold. Quite the gamble with such a huge unknown.     No one knows of a vaccine will be really effective or available either. You can mock the herd immunity scenario all you like but to me it's still the most logical one.     As the other countries gradually opens the number of infected will gradually rise once more. No matter how careful they are. It makes no difference!     No they won't if they don't reach heard immunity they will keep getting infected as the lockdown eases. It's what we're seeing now. The virus is not going to magically disappear if we stay at home. People who maintain lockdowns only delay the inevitable.     Some countries brought their infections down to zero like Vietnam &amp; New Zealand. Many others brought their infection rate down to a low level where they can mostly return to normal and use test/trace/isolate to stop outbreaks before they become very deadly.	0
Part 9Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”Part 5Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.FREDIBOATPart 10Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, FREDIBOATPart 11many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  FREDIBOATPart 12WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    FREDIBOATPart 13Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this FREDIBOATPart 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. FREDIBOATPart 15Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eatingFREDIBOATPart 16What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. FREDIBOATPart 17Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularlyFREDIBOATfor the latest news.Part 18You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with FREDIBOATPart 19droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many FREDIBOATPart 20surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. FREDIBOATPart 21This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such asPart 22cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will FREDIBOATPart 23have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.FREDIBOATPart 24Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? FREDIBOATPart 25You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.**********Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for FREDIBOATPart 26everyone)Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or FREDIBOATPart 27to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 FREDIBOATPart 28Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.FREDIBOATPart 29How likely am I to catch COVID-19?The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places aroundPart 30the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure toPart 31comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in FREDIBOATPart 32China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.

 Can you give a timeline on when we should expect to hear the results of this “conversation” with your management team? People have been asking this question for months and the excuse was “season isn’t officially over”. Well now it is. I get that things take time but this really Rep on Chat was zero help. Directed me to contact the  for a refund for a service that I pay Shaw for? Makes no sense. Webpage the rep told me to visit isn’t even an active webpage, returns a 404 error. Also told me season isn’t over even though it is. Not impressed I can definitely understand where you're coming from. The charges are set by the network. We'll have to wait their decision on this. ^AL Who is “they”? Who’s decision are we waiting for? The league has already officially said the regular season is finished. That’s all CI is good for. Regular season finishes, centre ice finishes. I pay Shaw for a service, I didn’t receive the service. Credit my account the money As mentioned earlier, I'll take this back and share this with our management team. ^AL Just seems like a run around, passing the buck like the online agent did (“we don’t issue the refunds/credit, you have to contact the NHL”)	0

"Pres. Obama on SanBernardino: ""We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country.""   sure do.  In GUN FREE ZONES  - Amazing how fast BHO commented on it. He only chooses to comment on matters that advance his slanted agenda. Thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims and their families. CORRECT MR.PRESIDENT BUT THERE R MANY THAT JUST REFUSE TO TAKE ACTION BY LISTENING AND WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE they happen every day in your home town of Chicago but you say NOTHING sir! Get off your hypocritical high horse! ...no we have a pattern of sick people!!!! on his watch... Soon he will announce a special TRACK, Czar, to head up:-Total-Response-Access with-Collaborative-Knowledge...just suggesting we all should be able to carry guns so if it's going to go down. At least you can defend yourself. Not wait on cops. wake up Mr president this pattern existed well before S. Bernardino, your realization is very inopportune ForgiveMeForAsking but can our POTUS show genuine emotion without hiding behind a political agenda? ~ Who is more likely to welcome Expanded, near unlimited, Police Powers, a  RWRat or a liberty loving Democrat? OnlyFacistsKill funny how the pattern developed during your reign,  we have a well greased terror into the wilderness in play. Thank you O and lapdog media  no we have a pattern of Islamic terrorists! NoSyrianRefugees It is a PATTERN n its becoming the NORM so do something about it DOMESTIC Terrorism is WORST than foreign because they are already HERE that's ridiculous where has he been hiding? What a joke! that's not on his agenda, none of those vote all occurring during Obama's administration we have to take advantage of our Constitutional right to bear arms and defend ourselves ! I guess the 400+ people murdered by gangs in Obama's hometown Chicago don't count - the criminals have no problems arming themselves! and we have had gun free zones since George Bush signed it into law.  Laws don't stop evil actors bent on killing people.  show some respect doorknob. He fought to give you the freedom to be a jerk &amp; say something unintelligent like that! Thank you captainobvious. Putting your harvardlaw degree to good use I see.   POTUS is sounding like an ass clown! we need a pattern of people defending themselves how about reintroducing fire arms classes in schools guns don't shoot, people do. cars don't drink, people do. what is the cause? and how can we fix it? real answers here -  ""Never let a crisis go to waste"", Obama's motto. where was Obama when cops were being killed.  Bet he tries to downplay this if it is terrorist Gun control laws. Advocates and Detractors must find solution How many more people are to be sacrificed before we sit up and act  It should be against the law for Islamic terrorists to shoot people in California. and strangely, just in the last 7 years.  Hmmm...  maybe that's b/c it 'could have been' his son. - Boy.......he's a WIZ 2 have figured THAT out! Obama No evidence of attacks during holiday        if you still have to wrap your head around the last shooting and already have a new one to process, it's more than a pattern. We do have a pattern of mass murders perpetrated by illegals since Obasturd took office. The blood of 10,000+ citizens is on his hands  thank you Mr President, you've succeeded We have a pattern now of politicians &amp; a president that uses tragedy as a public relations advocacy for gun control.

   Because coronavirus has something behind it. What good is Wuhan Virus? The virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China? What good does that do anyone? At least when someone asks 'what is a coronavirus?' some info can be given on that. This makes me so angry it is COVID19  or coronavirus it is not Wuhan Virus and the shit could be anywhere!   Technically coronavirus is more correct given that it IS a type of coronavirus. Calling the Wuhan Virus is useless, uninformative and given the climate in the US just invites more trouble for Asian Americans.   No, because it doesn't tell you anything about what it does to the body. There's a reason why the WHO put out guidelines for naming new viruses, although unfortunately the system is still not 100% on track.   Which is due to ignorance or lack of knowledge, not the name itself. Spanish Flu, Wuhan virus, neither of these things tell you anything under examination. Stop trying to justify bad naming conventions.   From what I can tell it's a shorthand for Coronavirus disease 2019. Certainly less than a mouthful.   And that clearly isn't a good enough reason for you, it seems   JFC. Viruses spread. Every one of them. Avoiding China wouldn't have stopped it. I'm aware most ppl don't know much about coronaviruses but the point is one can find productive information about them.Do you think Ebola is only found in the Democratic Republic of Congo? C'mon.	0

Should I worry about COVID-19? Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.It's a Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A.Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized.Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.Should I wear a mask to protect myself? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.The mask can only be used once.If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? No. There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.Is there anything I should not do? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:1. Smoking2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 3. Wearing multiple masks 4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.CoronaAlert coronavirus CoronaOutbreakThread	0

 @__sammy_r Från who:Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.VIRUS: CORONA KAN SMITTA UTAN ATT BÄRARE HAR SYMPTOM - WHO Det var ju positivt :/@__sammy_r har du länk? Saxat från DIRB fanns ingen länk där@__sammy_r DIRB?För jag hittar inte på WHOs hemsida @__sammy_r However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. @__sammy_r WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.Länk. 	0

"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people it can take even longer for symptoms to appear.Symptoms can include:●Fever●Cough●Trouble breathing●Feeling tired●Muscle achesMost people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death. This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.Should I see a doctor or nurse?If you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID-19, call your doctor or nurse. You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days●You lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about which areas are affected. This can be found on their website: You had close contact with a person who has the virus – This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.If your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. They can tell you what to do and where to go. If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask.The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people.The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people.If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead. This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. They will also ask questions about any recent travel and whether you have been around anyone who might be sick.Will I need tests?Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have COVID-19, they test samples of fluid taken from inside your nose and mouth. They might also do tests on a sample of mucus that you cough up, as well as your urine and stool (bowel movements).Your doctor might also order a chest X-ray to check your lungs.How is COVID-19 treated?Most people with COVID-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. If you have more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""ICU"").There is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions, and make you as comfortable as possible.You might need extra oxygen to help you breathe easily. If you are having a very hard time breathing, you might need to be put on a ventilator. This is a machine to help you breathe.Can COVID-19 be prevented?There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID-19:●Wash your hands with soap and water often.●Avoid touching your face with your hands.●Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.●Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID-19.Experts do not recommend wearing a face mask if you are not sick, unless you are caring for someone who has (or might have) COVID-19.If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:●Keep the sick person away from others – The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.●Use face masks – The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. If you are caring for the sick person, you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room.●Be extra careful around body fluids – If you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear a disposable face mask, gown, and gloves. If any body fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.●Clean often – It's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, and bathroom surfaces.●Wash hands – Wash your hands with soap and water oftenHow can I prepare for a possible COVID-19 outbreak?It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.If there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. If this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.There are things you can do to prepare for this. For example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.This way you will be able to receive and share information easily.If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. While it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk, try not to panic.Where can I go to learn more?As we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. Check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself."	0

Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

What is a coronavirus?Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold tomore severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. TThese droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in dropletsfrom a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.	0

8. Hand dryers kill coronavirusHand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneselfThread about some popular myths on corona virus1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyApplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skinThese cannot kill viruses within the body!!6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirusCurrently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus7. Face masks protect against coronavirusDisposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldAll Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.10. Antibiotics kill coronavirusAntibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusThermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonsCOVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy.

"So what is Sweden pursuing, exactly? The strategy rests on a few pillars. 1) lockdowns are wrong 2) you are delaying deaths into the future 3) we are building herd immunity 4) we can spread the virus safely Debunked, one by oneAnd that's why they have always been strong opponents of lockdowns: Tegnell repeatedly said there was no evidence they would work. I mean, what have the lockdowns ever done for us? And to be fair, in theory it would have been an interesting question to explore back in March: are we sure they help? But we did not have a EU-sized laboratory nor the time to get data in. We had to act first. All we had is a control group, Sweden, which did not do very well1) As the BBC article demonstrates, lockdowns greatly reduced the number of new cases in many countries. They saved lives, they bought us time, they contained potential superspreader events, and more2) If you read the news in Sweden, in March they kept repeating that all the countries that went into lockdown will face a tragic second wave, hence we were doing the right thing by carefully spreading the virus now. Let's put it that statement to test, shall we?Denmark and Norway and Finland lifted their restrictions about the same days, let's use May 11th (DK and NO) as the ref. One month ago. How many more deaths have occurred in Scandinavia since our neighbors exited lockdowns? SW  1493 DK      74 FI        57NO     22 3) But we are smart, we are building herd immunity! [Side note: the argument is so morally repugnant I won't even begin to unpack it, as it reeks of social darwinism, but let's try and keep it aside, albeit difficult to keep aside. Anyhow let's go ahead]Herd immunity my a$$. You should never allow a bunch of people who suck at math take a ""calculated risk"". It is spreading slower than much more painfully than thought before  Coda: and it's not only the snapshot of today/ this week, it's the direction that is worrisome. Today Italy has found 202 new positive cases, Sweden (1/6th of the population) 776Data as we stand today New cases 🇮🇹 202 🇸🇪776 New deaths 🇮🇹 71 🇸🇪67Currently in ICU 🇮🇹 249 🇸🇪283 Sweden has 1/6 of the populationHowever, direction is important too. Sweden is nowhere near limiting the spread (because, surprise, it has no intention to). *Partly* because we finally started testing more, but largely because we have a lot of infections, numbers are going up, not down There is no bending the curve necessary in the fantasy land of the we-should-soon-become-immune people Now, both countries have a large CFR -mortality for every 100 people found positive. And to Sweden's credit they have finally started testing more (bravo!) But it's still high at 10% And our policy as it stands is *designed* to produce new infections in the range of 500-600 per day (even if you dismissed the lab in Stockholm as a statistical fluke). How come Swedes are accepting a magnitude of 20x the deaths of their nordic neighbors? Be still, my heart"	0

What is COVID-19?COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 	0

9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?CORONA VIRUS.Thread.6. So, how does the disease spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.7. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.8. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.12. What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyone!Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.13.(A)However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:13.(B)Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.13. (C)Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.	0

6. It’s pointless? Men have always had more rights than woman and have always been seen as superior in history, why do we need it?Pls I’m bored 3. Valid and deserve the same recognition as any other part of the LGBTQ community4. Honestly idc and I don’t think other people should either, worry about yourself ya know?5. To put it simply, feminism is wanting women to be seen as equal to men and I’m all for that so I would consider myself a feminist.7. Just because it’s long distance doesn’t mean it isn’t real. They’re just as valid 💗8. Regular citizens shouldn’t have access to these huge powerful guns that can be used for mass shootings. It would make sense to have access to MAYBE a hand gun if someone feels they need protection but there’s absolutely no reason for owning something more dangerous than that.9.

 Swedish government flat-out says they are hoping for herd immunity, which justifies their lax position on social distancing even it is wrong-headed.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.	0

5. Everyone with COVID-19 diesThis statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. In fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalizationThread about some popular myths on corona virus1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyApplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skinThese cannot kill viruses within the body!!2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at riskSARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirusCurrently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus7. Face masks protect against coronavirusDisposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.8. Hand dryers kill coronavirusHand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldAll Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.10. Antibiotics kill coronavirusAntibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusThermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonsCOVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray. Shambho Mahadeva🙏      _kala59  _jr _IR _tinku 	1

MakeAmericaGreatAgain 🇺🇸🇨🇱    in polls of grandparents with land lines.  shows  winning 93% V4B   You can't win the race of you're running backwards.    CNN is now Fox News2  as her lead in the south is 6-1 let's report it all.   get on board buddy! Bernie2016 is for the people, and honestly she can't win the G.E. too much distrust   Sanders talks a good game about things he can't possibly deliver.  He's near comical.    Time for Hillary to quit if she has even an ounce of respect for America and her people.   Bernie speaks well, good ideas.   Brought to you by the party that gave Iran the bomb. Run on that.    his values are more democratic and less plutocratic every campaign has ups and downs. I worked on Obamas and we had great and horrible months. It's a marathon, not a sprint.  And yet Sen Sanders stands up for Democratic party principles better than most elected Democrats. Weird, huh?   Anyone but Hilary.  Absolutely anyone... What was your first clue?   I reckon that for Hillary Clinton losing the nomination to Barak Obama was most probably The End.   Be not stunned by your progress which reflects America's desire for sincere service. Steward our faith.     Bernie casts no shade.  50 years in politics &amp; he's stood for the same things.  :) Hillary can't tell the truth on anything .. In Time people will see her as she is ... She is just like Obama.. Shady   As long as she is still in the lead Bernie will sleep well, what difference does it make? Oops Um journalism much or just shill for Hillary? FACT: BOTH NH, OH polls have Bernie leading in 20 pt swing   she is tough but nobody wants to vote for her.  slow but steady wins the race..!  Hillary 2016   thats what you get for trying to whip and nae nae. FeelTheBern bishhhh   pl lot pl   yeah except for that's  ;)   A new down for america with clinton   Bernie admits he's NOT a democrat   That is what happens when you tout a fake scandal 24/7. We are still seeing stories about Benghazi.   could those Bernie Ts come in a hoodie please?    .Go Bernie!   HILLARYFORPRISON bernieisakook   Bernie will be a great president.   BERNIE IS THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE   why isnt' bill helping hillary. might give her more support. or ppl take notice_cam  That's funny, since they're STILL not hardly talking about  on there.   Feel the Bern! Go Bernie Go!  but he will slide clear off the rink in the south she is up 6-1 NEXT    he does, but his policies are more of Democrat policies than the ""so called"" Democrats Why is Larry Lessig not listed in this poll? PPP puts him at over 1% support, and unlike Biden, he is actually in the race.   FEEL THE BERN   There's a 99% chance  will fight his ass off for you and your family if elected. FeelTheBern    Now there are TWO UGLY faces ""Lincoln Chafee logs""? Really? ;-)  At this rate, she be giving her acceptance speech from jail.  Most dems don't even act like dems. We have a true left in  !Moderates=right of center!    So the GOP is now getting 40% of the Hispanic vote?  NO. Then HRC/Bernie WILL win   at some point one has to come clean about their shady selves- we are waiting.......Dekulakization?

"On the one hand, what is a coronavirus when held up against the universe? Practically nonexistent in scope, right? We're practically nonexistent ourselves...On the other hand, we're all kinda tiny ""universes"" and our complexity makes this nanoscopic particle (120nm) significant.Keep Calm &amp; Stay Home.

  _pastor  What do these 2 results mean? The PCR (6/11) test as POSITIVE means there are RNA fragments in the patient. Dallas counts this as a “new case” The IgG test (6/12) shows the patient is cured and now immune. The PCR can’t determine active vs. viral fragments!!! Our hospitalizations for COVID19 reached 400 patients today; the highest ever. Think of hospitalizations as the tip of the iceberg you see and know there are a lot more undiagnosed cases in the community. Go to  or my pinned tweet for Dr recs to stay safe. Those all COVID hospitalizations, or do they include other underlying conditions?  Serious question...  _pastor  Note, it takes approximately 14 days to generate IgG, so you could not be positive for active virus/infection and positive for IgG. IgG is the result of your immunological success over the virus.  _pastor  IgG shows the pt. is healed and immune. PCR is flawed b/c it being “positive” (6/11/20 test) does NOT mean they actively have live virus, as PCR tests for RNA fragments. But Dallas County cites this as a “new case”, even though she first was a “new case” over a month ago.	0

Where are all the women and children refugees? hope they put chips in those future terrorists...BTW...where are the women and children? I wonder how many ""refugees"" arrived in London so far...  what are the gun laws in New Orleans?   military-aged men just left the women and children in the warzone.   Well they voted for it...wait they didn't?   Ummmm, a google search shows that photo was taken 3 months ago in Europe... :-/  Good thing New Orleans never has large crowds of people in the streets or stadiums...

 _LTx   je ne sais pas. mais je crois la congélation est inutile. according to WHO, “Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.”.

Sur une infographie que j'ai vu passer on disait de seulement laver les légumes et fruits   Oui c'est ça_LTx    Quant à la viande, il suffit de la faire cuire lors de faire de la cuisine. c'est un virus de RNA,  Il est fragile et fait de protéines. cela signifie que une haute température peut changer sa nature et le tuer. (56° c -30 mins, 100°- 1s , c'est suffisant.) Maintenant ma réponse est oui. il y a quelques cas récents mais on ne sais pas comment ils sont infectés.Un expert en biologie crois qu’ils sont liés à la viande décongeléeMalgré une explication non officielledonc il faut laver de la viande avant de faire entrer dans le frigo _LTx   2.Chine a fermé la voie de l'Everest de peur que le virus y fasse irruption	0

Part 6How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. FREDIBOATPart 5Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.FREDIBOATPart 7These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19Part 8who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    FREDIBOATPart 9Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”Part 5Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.FREDIBOATPart 10Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, FREDIBOATPart 11many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  FREDIBOATPart 12WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    FREDIBOATPart 13Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this FREDIBOATPart 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. FREDIBOATPart 15Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eatingFREDIBOATPart 16What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. FREDIBOATPart 17Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularlyFREDIBOATfor the latest news.Part 18You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with FREDIBOATPart 19droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many FREDIBOATPart 20surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. FREDIBOATPart 21This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such asPart 22cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will FREDIBOATPart 23have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.FREDIBOATPart 24Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? FREDIBOATPart 25You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.**********Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for FREDIBOATPart 26everyone)Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or FREDIBOATPart 27to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 FREDIBOATPart 28Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.FREDIBOATPart 29How likely am I to catch COVID-19?The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places aroundPart 30the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure toPart 31comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in FREDIBOATPart 32China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.

Due to the answer to one of the questions about the ways of protection against COVID_19, a big misunderstanding occured about using or not using Vitamin C. since the answer including the things which may be harmful like alcohol,smoking and herbal tea AND taking vitamin C, got viral in Iran. I wanted you to clarify the answer again. Is vitamin c useful to increase the quality of immune system or it is harmful in this case of COVID_19 Thanks for sharing. In Iran, we need the urgent intervention of the World Health Organization to prevent disaster.  This government has no crisis management at all.  I am absolutely appalled by the lack of measures put in place at train stations and airports across Europe. Strict checks should be in place at every large city for both departures and arrivals in order to mitigate the risk of virus carriers spreading the disease. I travelled from London to Milan and Paris to London the last few days. Milan, only arrival passengers are being monitored for the disease while Paris Gare du Nord has no measures in place whatsoever. What is being done to fight this global pandemic ?

ITS AN ESSENCE OF YOUR JOB TO INFORM ABOUT DISEASES, SO WHAT THE HELL... What happened to your daily media conference? The virus can be transferred thru droplets. It can be transmitted through aerosols, if you’re in the same room as some1 &amp; they are breathing the same air, you can get the virus (masks &amp; eyewear are key). It can be transmitted through urine &amp; faeces - don’t use public toilets. The only advice for the world is don't trust WHO.

3. Taking a hot bath doesn't prevent you from catching COVID-19.4. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new kind that was discovered in 2019 and hasn't been previously identified in humans. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, and even death. 5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Follow the directions of your local health authority.6. Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Things that need more attention about COVID-19 :1. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.2. Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.5. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.6. UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.7. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have fever because of the new coronavirus infection. But, cannot detect people who are infected without fever.8. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body won't kill viruses that have already entered your body.9. Vaccines against pneumonia, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.10. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.11. Garlic may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.12. People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).13. Antibiotics don't work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and antibiotics shouldn't be used as a means of prevention or treatment.14. There is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Thanks for your nice attention.Source : 	0

6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirusCurrently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virusThread about some popular myths on corona virus1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyApplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skinThese cannot kill viruses within the body!!2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at riskSARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.7. Face masks protect against coronavirusDisposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.8. Hand dryers kill coronavirusHand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldAll Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.10. Antibiotics kill coronavirusAntibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusThermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonsCOVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray. Shambho Mahadeva🙏      _kala59  _jr _IR _tinku 	1

Yeah, Covid-19 is just like the flu.  Lucky for me Tim , I live in AZ and have a look at the high temps this weekend. By Monday the Virus 🦠 should be gone , right ? 🤔🤪🤔 Trump is a baby dressed in a badly fitted suit.  Have a friend who works in a hospital admin position they suggest there will be a future category for covid survivors like coal miners with black lung disease. I asked if that had been determined? They looked surprised like a secret slipped out. Well yeah. You’re gonna get a little of that. That’s what I’ve been wondering. What are the long-term effects? So COVID19  is actually as bad for you as eating regularly at Chick-fil-A. @__Chimaera It’s the common cold, Tim! It’s the common cold!

Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.Pls Don't panic people with fake news because it's not real All Facts are in these threads 	0

Q: Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?A: At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs, cats can be infected with the virus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. *  has developed a series of scientific-based Q&amp;As and public health advice to help curb rumours &amp; provide timely &amp; accurate info on coronavirus   For cats, some of them also have coronavirus in them tapi it's different strain and biasanya jadi kes FIP je. And this one, at the moment memang confirm tak boleh transmit to human. Since different strain, of course cats tak boleh jadi host lain strain. I worked in vet clinic. I recently read that the Chinese are having to consider their pets can get, and spread the virus. And y’all gotta put a cute cat there virus ni belum cukup point nak beli perk kott  Poor all animals 😣😣😣 Can they really? Ya Allah lepas tu guna gambar cute miut ni buat apa? Pity our furry friends. Hopefully its a false alarm.  Why even post this??? If humans got it from animals... then animals may just as well get it back from humans. Depends on what animals; you need to refer taxonomy. There's high chance if they fall into the same category e.g mammals Logic dictates otherwise, folks... This rumor was confirmed false please delete this immediately  Cats and dogs can get coronavirus, but the strain they get is NOT contagious to humans. semoga haiwan dilindungi Tuhan. Tips : Sarung jelaa mask kat kucing tu. Protect.Kalau nak bawak keluar jejalan, sapu hand sanitizer kat dia.
