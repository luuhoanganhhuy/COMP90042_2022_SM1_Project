why have there been more mass shootings under obama than the 4 previous presidents combined?  	1

  because he was born on a tuesday.	1
bcuz obama is a muslim -- media u can stop hiding his dirty underwear- do ur job. elect samm tittle  	1

 it probably depends on how the website maint contracts were set-up and where they're feds or contractors running them. (?)	1

 well of course... this is part of the smoke and mirrors. what can we shut down that will piss off the most people?	1
   they do have bandwidth &amp; electricity costs. plus many gov sites run on aws cloud at hourly rates.	1

plagiarism is the new virus, what is covid-19? 	0
 covid got competition now 😂	0
 at least turnitin is a cure for this virus	0
misconceptions 1.) covid-19 is just like the flu/another strain of the flu. 2.) covid-19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu. 3.) younger individuals should not be worried about the virus.	1
of greater concern to younger individuals, and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of covid-19 in this coming fall. (4) the reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infect	1
all individuals, young and old and typically more virulent as well.(5) which brings me to point 4.  4.) the actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction.	1
the prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in covid-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of covid-19 in the fall able to severely	1
affect all individuals as the more covid-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) the stopping of the spread of covid-19 now is crucial to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly,	1
immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. it should also be noted that not extending the course of the covid-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace as	1
a result of financial need leading to increased spread. (7,8)i would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic, and i applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases.	1
i am, however, passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases. i highly encourage everyone of you to do your research, educate yourself on how you can best help yourself, your family,	1
and your community. the efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort. the actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come.	1
i urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself. references1)2)3) 4) 5)	1

what are the symptoms of covid-19? is covid-19 airborne? here are the answers to your biggest questions about the coronavirus pandemic 	0
 i think coronavirus is airborne	0
 doesn’t load properly. please fix.	0
 initially it's exhaled water droplets which can be inhaled or by transferance from surfaces.the virus can survive on anything except copper and live up to three days.	0

as we reopen ohio, people will have to be very, very careful until we get a vaccine. you'll have to weigh benefit vs. risk. you will have to make sure you're wearing a mask when you go out, continue social distancing, etc. covid19 is not going away until we get a vaccine.	0
 all y’all responding that it’s your choice he’s not talking about just you. of course you can make the decision to take the risk but if you get sick it’s not just “your problem.” if the hospitals get overwhelmed that’s his problem.	0
 if you end up hospitalized and the nurse who takes care of you catches it and can’t work to help save others or worse yet becomes gravely ill or dies because of you is that still not “your problem!?” why cant we as humans care about others more than ourselves?	0
  you’re right! numbers don’t lie! i guess i’m just confused where you are getting your numbers... 	0
15. drinking alcohol does not protect you against covid-19 and can be dangerous 	0
14. covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates 	0
16. being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (covid-19) or any other lung disease. 	0
17. you can recover from the coronavirus disease (covid-19). catching the new coronavirus does not mean you will have it for life. 	0
18. exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25c degrees does not prevent the coronavirus disease (covid-19) 	0
19. 5g mobile networks do not spread covid-19 	0
cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus.there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the external temperature or weather.	0
by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. 	0
the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.	0
to protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. 	0
are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. 	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. 	0
how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.	0
however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. 	0
can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.	0
spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. 	0
do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.	0
the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.	0
although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. 	0
can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.	0
there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. 	0
can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 	0
does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.	0
who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. 	0
are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.	0
some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.pls don't panic people with fake news because it's not real all facts are in these threads 	0

  i thought muslims don't eat pork? whats with the wipes? i like there biscuits....	1

  if the muslims are idiotic enough to suck on the wipes, it's their problem, not kfc's.	1
  well said and how come they are never offended by the benefits they claim from us infidels	1
.  ---&gt;  &lt;---- can suck it!	1
 ban muslims if they don't like what we have, well they can just move back to the hell hole they came from! r shut up!	1
  that seems very extreme. diverse cultures have an option to partake or abstain..if u disagree- don't use them.	1

 that's right patriot. we need to let the corporates who really is in charge in america; that being we the american people.	1

 if an alcohol wipe offends then i guess they should just use their shit covered hands to eat the halal crap. 	1
 it already is, when the likes of anjem chowdry freely roam the streets of londonistan!  	1
 why boycott them over a staff members mistake? not policy?	1
  you need the wipes for greasy chicken	1
.  (a) it was a halal kfc (think kosher), targeted to muslim customers, not a regular kfc; (b) it was staff error	1
  isn't it rubbing alcohol?  the stuff that'll make you go blind you if you drink it?	1
  wow!!! they didn't tell them that the chicken is cooked in pig lard???? lmao	1

 this is stupid though. muslims just can't consume alcohol, there's nothing wrong with hand wipes containing alcohol!?	1

@_sh4 ny/nj/ct continue to trend down in daily new cases even as many other states have either stopped their downward trend or inflected upward since the mass protests started. estimates of prevalence are 20-25%, well below the herd immunity threshold. so what is going on?	0
@_sh4 ... is an issue, but i am not sure the situation warrants the kind of hopelessness and unpredictability conveyed here.	0
 to paraphrase jonathan haidt, this is the coddled american mind...	0
 the preamble of political opinions about masks, etc. makes me wonder if the hopelessness, as you point out, is intended to make a political point. it seems like a tactic to scare ppl into wearing masks.	0
@_sh4 yeah those were the elements that made me think that. btw speaking of your contempt for epidemiologists there is something very interesting going on that they need to get into the bottom off ...	0
@_sh4 it is not just mask compliance. i have noticed in nj increasing socialization and crowding in public places as the state has reopened. yet we don't detect a pickup in cases. could it be that herd immunity can be reached at lower levels than thought or perhaps seroprevalence ...	0
@_sh4 ... estimates are missing true infection attack rates? it is quite puzzling but i see no attempts to engage with it by epidemiologists.	0
" what is wrong with this guy?  we have plenty of testing.  so much testing that sites shut down from lack of demand.  the goalposts constantly shift for team apocalypse.  no amount of testing, serology testing, contact tracing, anything will satisfy their desire for ""safety."""	0
no. a just government protects our rights. you want a mommy to care for you. america was founded by men who wanted to live free. 	0
  and the stupid thing about testing is that if a person is found not to have the virus that day, he could get it the next, so it's pretty pointless.	0

myths about the corona virus1. taking ice cream and other cold foods do not facilitate or aid the onset of the disease.2. taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease.3. the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted via mosquito bites. 	0
4. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
5. thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.	0
5. thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.	0
this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.	0
6. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces,	0
but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.7. antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
8. to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.	0

  (1) jesus forbid circumcision even if he was circumcised against his will.it's the protestants who reintroduced it because they follow judaïsm and not catholicism which by the way was 100% anti judaïsm until the free-masons infiltrated it and changed it from the inside during	0
  (2) the renaissance.the americans are the most stupid and evil people on earth, nothings to do with religions, they are the sewer of europe, the worst of the worst, convicts, rapists, murderers, crooks, etc	0
  (3) europe didn't want them and unfortunately didn't exterminate them, instead they sended them to the new world (new jerusalem) and since then they fuck up the world even more than the jews.	0
  (4) i'm not christian but jesus hated the jews, that's why they had him killed, christianism is a poison yes but jesus was not part of it, he was a jew who hated his own race like so many more jews...	0
   we don't need to have a desert cult faith, i never said that, we only need to get rid of (((them))) once and for all and varg is right but the problem is even without christianism, the jews will still control us, they are everywhere, not just in christianism	0

 _boylan no it hasn't there is no proof regarding 5g	0
 _boylan you are absolutely correct.. there is no proof its dangerous or safe. the lack of safety testing concerns me.. i know we all have mobile phones, wifi routers, microwaves and several other devices that transmit some kind of radio waves but 5g is at least 10 times the strength.	0

 _boylan yes i can considering i work in the field myself	0
 _boylan do you.. so is it true they operate at 60ghz and above. the same frequency as a military ray gun	0
 _boylan no thats a myth we have no where that came from. 5g can carry a frequency up to 300ghz but the frequency range that will be used for 5g will be between 3.3ghz and 4.2ghz	0
 _boylan let me put it another way i am assuming you have wifi at home. and during this lockdown have you noticed it being a bit slower than normal that's due to the volume of people logging on which in turns makes it slower. 5g removes that	0
 _boylan i understand that the wifi is slower at the moment and if everything goes back to normal, it will return to normal. the 4g on my network hasn't really changed.. i also don't believe that 5g is covid. it is just coincidental that this is happening at the same time.	0

"  right. but individual responsibility requires individual responsibility. these idiots are advocating football games, going to the beach, and movie theaters. they believe covid-19 is ""just like the flu"" and refuse to take responsibility for their thinking or actions."	1
the president uses vague calls to action so he can avoid responsibility and later claim he meant something else. just yesterday, he was outlining a phased approach for “opening up america again.” he should be specific about his concerns. which measures are okay and which are not? 	1
 how about just an emphasis on individual responsibility again?  it’s ok to educate on wearing gloves and masks and staying inside without enforcing it as law.	1
   true. but it's hard to trust people to not go if the idiots keep swarming toward them.the whole thing about freedom is it comes with responsibility.a society filled with people who are incapable of exercising freedom without hurting others is a doomed society.	1

  _jaycee just wanting you stop being scared.  we know it's nothing to be afraid of unless you choose to be.  recent antibody tests show that it has a very low fatality rate and has likely been here since late 2019. you may choose fear if you wish. 	0
  _jaycee i'm  not afraid for myself. it's  the ppl in my community  i want kept safe. when vacationers come here and they've got 20 in a room and the restaurants same then a service station movies.  who you think's going to get sick the people that live here. i care for my community.	0

 admittedly, the [hcq] reached is at upper end of what used for rha, but within that range.	0

i. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
d. how can i protect myself you can protect yourself by:-  washing your hands with soap and running water frequently : before and after eating, after using toilet, touching animals or animal waste- covering mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing	0
- avoiding close contact with anyone who shows symptoms.- seek medical care if you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing.trending coronavirusoutbreak	0
- have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care- do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick	0
- are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected coronavirus infection	0
g. how to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask •before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.•cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.	0
•avoid touching the mask while using it;•replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use is advised.	0
h. does the new coronavirus affect older peoplepeople of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus	0
however, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.	0
j. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.	0
however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support.	0
the goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.	0
 is this evidence that herd immunity is ultimately needed? if you have a series of lockdowns followed by a series of new peaks - what is the point of lockdown?	0
for countries like bulgaria that locked down incredibly early, prevented much of a spread at all and then reopened, the renewed spike puts them in an awkward position. 	0
  unfortunately untrue: if you do herd immunity it’s going to get out of control within an instant which will overwhelm the icu units especially in a country like america which only has a healthcare system for the rich. even germany was on the brink of exhaustion in nrw region	0
  not in the uk with our expanded capacity	0
can eating garlic help prevent the virus?garlic does have antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from outbreak that garlic has protected people from the virus.does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?	0
common questions about covid-19 	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps shouldn’t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause cell deaths. how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?	0
thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever because of infection with the virus.they can’t detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. due to it taking between 2-10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.	0
can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).	0
do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the virus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, do not provide protection against the virus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.	0
can rinsing your nose with saline help prevent the virus?no. there is no evidence that rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from the virus. there is some limited evidence that rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold.	0
people of all ages can be infected by covid-19. older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. are antibiotics effective in treating the virus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.	0

just announced in the uk:20,000 dead520,000 tested 150,000 tested positiveextrapolating to the entire population of  66.5 million means there are 19 million infected.that puts the national death ratio = 0.11(cdc puts flu at 2.0)i am happy to be corrected.	1

  but what is herd immunity is much easier to attain than expected? this virus doesn’t grow exponentially.	0
  don't put words in my mouthi m concerned about the public health aspects first, economy second (like 70% of america, btw, data available by request). here in ct we shut down, got control, and like most in the northeast are opening slowly and with cautions like masks built in	0
  this is what i want	0
  what i see coming from you (and friends) is economy &gt; public health and so to get there, and justify that order of importance (since 120k have died), the virus is downplayed.younger infection is goodherd immunity is the way to goetcpublic health docs don't agree	0
  in my view, the way to help the economy is to get control of the virus, not vice versaand so 'you just want to close the economy' is false. it's a partisan charge.i want to control the virus to open the economyvaccine is the power tool in the toolbox not the only tool. /fin	0
  it grows exponentially. that's what's happening in az right now before your eyes.it would be great if herd if immunity was real and easy to achieve. that takes ~70% of the population assuming we're immune after infection (unproven, it's not true for other coronaviruses). but..	0

there are 3 currently identified coronaviruses1.the mers virus, or middle east respiratory syndrome.2. the sars virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the guangdong province in southern china3. the covid19 or the wuhancoronovirus	0
covid-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. it takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. symptoms may include:1.fever anyone with a measured temperature of at least 100.4 °f [38 °c]) 2. cough3. shortness of breath	0
there is currently no vaccine or treatment for covid-19. symptoms of a coronavirus usually go away on their own. if symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor to prescribe pain or fever medication.as with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest.	0

can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	0
can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.	0
however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  whowhatsapp	0

  you need to also consider that may are not tested due to widespread test shortage and the ~80% accuracy of the results. the m.e. is the one that lists cause of death on the death cert. and they are about 8 weeks behind. the numbers are certainly much higher than can be reported.	0
  if you cannot test accurately, you cannot get derive any numbers with accuracy that are predicated on positive results. the numbers are high, and even now the majority of people are distancing. death count is not very important. long term health problems are very important.	0

 is this picture true?	1
how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.	0
what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with ++	0
covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?	0
the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms.	0
this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.	0
you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.why?	0
when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.why?	0
hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.	0
this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately.why?	0
droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and covid-19. stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.	0
follow the directions of your local health authority.why? national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.	0
this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely). if possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++	0

how does covid-19 spread?at the moment, we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets. droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing.	0
as of today, 169,906 covid-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in 6,644 fatalities worldwide. after its discovery last december, in wuhan, china, the virus started to spread around the world, causing panic.	0
how do the seven humancoronaviruses differ?the main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. the first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while sars and mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity.	0
how do viruses work?a virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. it enters the cell through binding with receptors and “reprogrammes it” to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body.	0
the virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection.	0
there are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. but this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty.	0
how deadly is the new coronavirus compared to sars, mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold?we cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed.	0
also, with covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.the mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal.	0
it is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for sars-cov-2 is higher.	0
although compared to sars (9.6 per cent) and mers (34.4 per cent), covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger.	0
can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus?for some respiratory viruses this does happen. not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. in this case, it is still premature to say.	0

_mueller tabitha, when do you think we can realistically expect reliable election results?	0
 i know that the indy is doing live coverage and will also have a website where we keep track and call the races, so that would be a good resource too -- sorry, for some reason twitter didn't send this final tweet (clearly social media and i are not exactly bffs)	0
_mueller excellent, thank you!	0
 it will depend on the race and how close the races are -- for wide margins it'll be easier to have a better idea. initial results should start coming in around 8:30 and will continue to be published until 12 on election day. everything is unofficial until june 19.	0
 8:30 p.m. to midnight -- sorry, twitter's character limit sometimes irks me	0

when this pandemic infected 26 of the population worldwide, it made me fear for my life. but now? it infected more than a hundred thousands of people, millions of people to be exact. what is “covid-19” anyway? it is a crisis that we all should take seriously. 	0
this pandemic, i became productive. i learned how to decipher codes, i get to watch a lot of animes and read many books. i am happy because i get to spend more time with my family like, watching movies, eating together and talked and talked about everything.	0
this pandemic started and the true face of the people also started to unmask. some families doesn’t have a proper home, some doesn’t have the stable job to provide the need for their family, and some doesn’t have the privilege to protect themselves during this pandemic.	0
what about them? there are people that are hoarding the necessities, to what? to benefit you from preventing the virus? to re-sell it at a higher price? these people didn’t even think about the people who doesn’t have enough money to buy enough necessities for their family. 	0
to be honest, i got mad at them. during this pandemic, i also realized how bad our government is. the president didn’t even bother to tell us the plan at an early time, instead he ordered the police and soldiers to kill everyone not obeying the rules. i mean????? 	0
the people not obeying the rules are hungry, they are waiting for the relief goods that was supposed to be distributed as soon as possible but nothing was distributed. 	0
i also realized that no matter how bad and irresponsible you are, if you have a position at the government and if you are rich, you can wander freely everywhere, spreading the virus and still be given compassion that you don’t deserve. 	0
this pandemic made me aware of the issues of what’s really happening. it angers me a lot, to be honest because if you don’t have the privilege, you are going to be ignored like a pest. that’s how dirty the government works.	0
we already have the highest number of covid-19 cases in southeast asia with minimal testing. without testing, we’re acting blind &amp; exposing the vulnerable— old, poor, and the jobless. i think that there will be no choice but to extend this lockdown. 	0
we should all cooperate during this lockdown. the government should provide our needs and necessities to prevent people from going outside. we can overcome this situation by cooperating and puting our faith to god and the frontliners. 	0
we also should give our biggest salute to our frontliners, not only they are giving their absolute best, but they are staking their lives as well. 	0

   _vogel     what is it for normal flu? guessing it's pretty high. given the extremely low average mortality rate for covid-19 i'd expect the nnt to be over 10,000, maybe much higher once herd immunity is reached worldwide. residual panic will no doubt help with sales.	0
   _vogel     agree meredith. but when herd immunity takes over, it will have fewer hosts. my belief is that immunity from a real infection is greater than that achieved from a vaccine. covid is so contagious that herd will occur prior to a vaccine.	0

  i hope people don't watch this bull****! no ratings for abc. sick	1
 source?	1
 the only one who can destroy your life is yourself. get up and do something and stop complaining. that goes for anyone.	1
 if that's true boycott all abc shows	1
  if a fund is set up to support the browns in a civil suit against wilson + ferguson pd then it would raise millions of dollars.	1
  there is a way to make them feel our pain...it is called boycott! abc	1
 yea and some jerk wants to invite him to the wh to let him know we appreciate him.	1
 _g22 you nitwits amped this non story up to ludicrous levels. strategy&gt;emotions.	1
  actually it was 513k and they had to sign notarized agreements promising not to give his location to anyone.	1
  if he retracted- they why did you need to mention his tweet at all?	1
 we need to boycott 	1
    this might seem like a strange question, by where does officer wilson expect to work 😢ferguson	1
  if they paid him $1 it was too much. i didn't watch it. boycottabcnews	1
 he will continue on his media tour as long as it remains profitable. he's no good for anything else, never was.	1
 this country is literally built on &amp; thru the destruction of black lives. that it continues is saddening, maddening, &amp; unsurprising.	1
 _milla he is now a success to the klan, and the man he married.	1
"“: y'all, i just read that abc paid darren wilson $500k for the interview.""  shame on you !!!!"	1
 fwiw  is a parody account for a character on hbo's the newsroom.  have no idea what their agenda is here.	1
 i bet the browns did every one of their interviews absolutely free, didn't they??	1
 _seiver read it on the internet? if so, it must be true!	1
  . i bet not. did u listen?  he's telling truth. u just don'twant to hear it!	1
  wilson will be on channel 7 @ 8 tonight. wonder what he'll get for that one. no matter ... i wont be watching.	1
 just ask zimmerman! 1st its interviews for pay then the gun show circuit for autographs for pay!	1
  add abc to my boycott list along with walmart, olive garden, fox pukes..err news, koch industrie,monsanto. arggh!	1
 _west white men get paid whether they do good or bad. white supremacy: rule no. 1.	1
 they ran out of animals..now they hunt us	1
  not black, but i believe it is wrong for him to get paid for this, wrong for abc to offer. how can anyone do this? sorry 4 all	1
 false it didn't even come from a reliable source	1
  and he wound up with the same amount in donations. sickening	1
  check that. abc doesn't pay for interviews beyond hotel and transportation.	1
 what????	1
  got a link?	1
    where on abc? if that's true he got a paid vacation and a million dollar bonus.	1
 are you serious???	1
      something in my mind is saying that, that, is illegal in itself.   aka; fortune hunters. vs infamy.	1
  again, who says a black man's life is worthless! ka-ching!	1
.  opportunity for black friday add bonanza on abc!	1
 he's gonna need that for the civil suit	1
source:  is this just networking smearing ea other? if real, shows being killer-cop pays like crime.  	1
  _sdad  well when he sues the nyt, sharpton and the rest i hope he bankrupts them all	1
 is it confirmed?	1
 really? i read they didn't pay him anything	1
 boycott abc as well !	1

 that's a special edition. not a murdoch fan but you're tweeting a rumor. november edition: 	1
 thats dreadful, i love national geographic mag feel sorry for all the staff that lost their jobs put me off reading it now	1
  i have subscribed for over 30 years. will give it up now.	1
  it’s a special if that’s any consolation.	1

"liar. that's a ""special"" out before the murdoch massacre, but you keep doing you spreading bullshit... "	1
  like midas, whatever murdoch touches is transformed. except into crap, not gold.	1
  nat'l geo tv has operated with that exact content for years.  just irrelevant.	1
   maybe not, but is a cover story than opens w praying to the virgin mary cures cancer any better?	1
 wake me up	1
  damn. can the just discovered remains of bat boy be far behind?	1
  r u kidding me???	1
 it was a decent magazine before   took over! the man ruins everything he touches :(	1
"not dumbing down (yet) - nat geo ""strange but true"" is one of many special issues.   "	1
  i'm very depressed now.	1
  it's fake	1
  that was a special edition from maybe just over a year ago. nothing to do with murdoch.	1
   did no such thing. fox didn't take ownership till mid-nov, post-layoffs.	1
  can you cancel a subscription?	1
  	1
  always sad to see someone i respect retweeting without stopping to consider the veracity of the tweet.	1
 disgusting. an insult to  academia and nature.	1
   oh dear. national geographic is now dead to me...   i had no idea murdoch owns that now.  :(	1
". as pointed out by many, natgeo has a supernatural special issue every year. this is it. it's shelved with ""specials."""	1
  how is this national geographic material?!	1
 no it didn't. that cover appeared in 2014 and was a special issue for non-subscribers.	1
 time for another boycott	1
  ...i'm in the know 😉	1
 hahahahahaha funny but sad.	1
  it's a special edition and nobody is sure if this came out before or after murdoch bought the magazine.	1
 well, mixed reviews on the pseudoscience of supernatural in this copy.	1
 😢	1
 don't get it	1
  what?!	1
this has nothing to do with murdoch and you know it. i can't stand the man either. 	1
  i would offer that it had been a crappy magazine well before the sale. 	1
   commissioned before the murdoch takeover, i believe.	1
  uhm, that is just a special edition.	1
"  i'm honestly more interested in that ""sandwich 06"" on the shelf below. is that a weird spin-off on sonic 06?"	1
  no, say it isn't so ... natgeo turning supermarket tabloid??? oh, the humanity ...	1
  rip national geographic	1
 - sadly will now never purchase again due to ownership	1
 sorry, no 	1
the answer is 42 😬	1
"  this is a ""special issue"" that was out prior to the acquisition"	1

          covid-19 is spread through respiratory droplets from person-to-person contact or through touching surfaces that have viral particles on them and then touching your face or mouth.  jciaukickoutcovid19 _nigeria  	0
          covid-19 can live on surfaces for a variety of different times so that’s why it’s so important to do frequent handwashing for at least 20seconds and disinfecting surfaces with cleaning products that are known to kill the virus.  jciaukickoutcovid19 _nigeria  	0
          social distancing and physical separation by at least 6 feet or 1 meter is vital to making sure that we limit viral spread. when we employ these recommendations fewer people become infected and therefore cannot go on to infect others.  jciaukickoutcovid19 _nigeria  	0
           what is currently known is spread through droplets (from coughing or sneezing) which can get into mucous membranes of the eye, mouth &amp; nose if the infected person is close-by or drops on a surface and introduced into these mucous membranes with our hands when we touch the surface	0

 yeah because there couldn't possibly be any other factors involved than the president.  that's sarcasm by the way.	1
 its worse than that i'm afraid. there has actually been 355 mass shootings in 2015 alone.	1
 worse, most irrelevant statistic on twitter today.	1
 this may be true, but  will just say it's bush jr's fault. he inherited the mess. noleadership wakeupamerica	1

what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 1/3	0
let´s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. let´s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. so here´s a thread of q&amp;a on coronaviruses (covid-19) from world health organization.covidfreeaprilcovidfreephilippinescovidfreeworld	0
what is a coronavirus?coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers, sars and now, covid-19.	0
what is covid-19?covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3	0
how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	0
can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2	0
however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0
 you have more info in this screen shot than any msm outlet will give you. yes used over a long time there will be issues. hcq is a lot milder and is also working ww to treat coronavirus 19. what is a coronavirus? does the common flu fall into that category? 	0

thread on covid19 spread &amp; testing.how does covid-19 spread?it spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. close contact, which is being closer than 6 feet for more than 10 minutes w/a sick individual, increases your risk of catching it. (1/12) covid19us 	0
… individuals with severe illness from covid-19 may need hospital care, which would still be supportive care of symptoms because there is no specific treatment for the disease… (5/12)covid19us	0
… whether you are positive or negative, we ask that people stay home for 72 hours after their symptoms end to avoid passing illness to others… (6/12)covid19us	0
… if you test positive for covid-19, you will need to stay home for 7 days after your positive test or for 72 hours after your symptoms end, whichever is longer… (7/12)covid19us	0
… this is different from flu, which has a specific antiviral medication that can be given if a flu test is positive. no specific treatment for covid-19 = no different care after a positive test result. (8/12)covid19us	0
who gets tested? how?anyone with symptoms can go to a healthcare provider. if the provider decides a test is needed, they can collect specimens and request a test from the state lab or order one from a commercial lab… (9/12)covid19us	0
… working with a provider is very important—a cough and fever can have many causes, so seeing a provider will help you get an answer about cause and treatment… (10/12)covid19us	0
… there is no specific treatment for covid-19, so if your symptoms are from some other cause, it’s important that you’re working with a provider who can help you get well. (11/12)covid19us	0

my kid is/i am coughing. should i ask for testing?contact a healthcare provider if you or your child has symptoms such as cough, fever, or shortness of breath. children typically have milder symptoms, more like a common cold… (2/12)covid19us	0
… treatment will not change based on a positive covid-19 test. positive or negative, treatment will be fluids, fever-reducing medication, rest, or other supportive care for symptoms… (3/12)covid19us	0
… there is currently no treatment specific to covid-19, so a positive test result only indicates the cause of illness, not any type of treatment… (4/12)covid19us	0

 from who info page. is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.	0
 in what way? this one spreads far quicker, and it has already reached far more people than sars did. also, it takes 4 to 5 weeks to die, and so nobody knows the fatality death rate yet.	0
 right off, his data is wrong. it started early december - not the 29th december. also the world health orgaization says it's worse than sars.	0
 if a disease only spreads to a thousand people, and it kills 10%, that is only a 100 dead. if a disease spreads to 5 million people, and it kills 3% (current fatality rate), it kills 30,000 people. it is the ease of spreading that makes it more dangerous.	0
 i would still put that on par with a bad flu bug, most people don't die from it and that fatality percentage can change based on how it's reacted to and where geographically you look.  with proper prevention this won't result in a pandemic.	0
 yes, i know that. but it takes approximately 5 weeks from the date of manifestation of the illness (not the incubation period) to die. most people have not recovered yet. so the death rate might be a lot higher. the fact that sars didn't spread easily means it was less dangerous.	0

   what is humorous about herd immunity?	0
florida gov  says state officials are making psas targeting younger floridians who have let their guard down abt spread of covid-19. median age of coronavirus cases in broward is now 33 yrs old. in duval, 30. in hillsborough co, it’s 31. in seminole, it’s 26 yrs old	0
    and we achieve herd immunity before the fall flu season.	0
   super funny til someone you know gets it and dies.	0
   not a damn thing; it's deadly serious. a lot of people would have to die in short order to get there quickly. you need 60-70% to achieve. i frankly don't feel like sacrificing a large percentage of people over 60 to do it. 🤷🏽‍♀️	0
   data is showing that the best way to avoid infecting the at-risk 60+ population is don’t put covid patients in nursing homes. the median age infected in the counties listed were all below 35. that’s exactly where you want the immunity to build.	0
covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.from the evidence so far, the covid-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, 	0
cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus.there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the external temperature or weather. 	0
the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. more info who: 	0

or travel to an area reporting covid-19. the best way to protect yourself against covid-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.	0

for asking that question, , you will be told that you are saying covid-19 is 'just like the flu'. it will be a lie. but it is the lie invariably told about anyone who asks about govt response to previous high fatalities from flu complications. why do govt supporters lie? 	1
"  copied from the ons site today: ""in week 13, 18.8% of all deaths mentioned “influenza or pneumonia”, covid-19, or both. in comparison, for the five-year average, 19.6% of deaths mentioned “influenza and pneumonia”.""  so less deaths from all 3 combined so far this year."	1
  it puts different people in hospital compared with flu. the data are clear on this. 	1
"  they also said: ""“influenza and pneumonia” has been included for comparison, as a well-understood cause of death involving respiratory infection that is likely to have somewhat similar risk factors to covid-19.""   key words - similar risk factors."	1
  god you people must walk around with your eyes close - this is a totally infectious disease , it absolutely is not the flu	1

  _doucette what the hell kind of situation do you even consider needing to take someone's prosthesis away? we don't accept the cops removing someone's body parts, and that's what prostetics are! you can and should expect absolute results when it's a disgusting abuse of human rights.	0
 _doucette 1/ 	0
 _doucette 2/	0
 _doucette neither of those answered my question. 'less common' implies it still happens.	0
 _doucette you cannot expect absolute results. you can make the conditions such to create disincentives for abuses and then use accountability on those who still abuse their position.	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	0
how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.	0
world health organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. 	0
" we are humans, we see patterns, similarities.  if someone were to ask you, ""what is covid-19 like?""...how would you answer?  would you say ""it's throughly dissimilar to anything else on earth?"".  of course not.  there are similarities...to many things on earth"	0
the death rate may be inflated, but this still illustrates why we must be cautious &amp; vigilant. we must reopen the economy but we must be smart and use common sense. please wear a mask and keep your distance. many companies have shown this is possible while keeping businesses open 	0
" that isn't even to mention how many of our 60k deaths that were incorrectly categorized as ""covid related"" or ""presumed covid related"", or ""underlying conditions that we think covid exasperated"""	0
 this point is why i explicitly mentioned “inflated” deaths.	0
 anything we put out in media...that has the objective of making people cautious, will make them scared.  anything that is supposed to make them respect the disease, will make them fear it.	0
 i don’t believe in fear-mongering. i also don’t believers prudent to censor the seriousness of this illness.	0
 i the purpose of the charts was specifically to make a direct comparison.	0
 it was to make a contrast.  not a comparison.  you expressly warned against comparisons.	0
j. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.	0
e. protecting others from getting sick you can protect others from getting sick taking the following precautions - when coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with elbow or tissue- throw the tissue in a bin immediately after use	0
- clean hands with soap after coughing or sneezing - avoid close contact when you are experiencing cough and fever- avoid spitting in public- seek medical care if your loved one have fever, cough or difficulty breathing.	0
- have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care- do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick	0
- are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected coronavirus infection	0
g. how to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask •before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.•cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.	0
•avoid touching the mask while using it;•replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use is advised.	0
h. does the new coronavirus affect older peoplepeople of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus	0
i. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
however, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.	0
however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support.	0
the goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.	0

first black female gop  returning donations from alleged white supremacist  	1
    because american have the dumbest racist people.	1
   😄😄..their plans wasn't going to work out😂😂😂..i'm still not voting for her😉	1
   wait. you had this evil person's money, and you gave it back to him?	1
      i think it is a diversion tactic, meant to muddle up the waters. i am not fooled.	1
  because her vote holds more value than her color, which speaks volumes about our political system	1
  already corrupt	1
   it's too late. well my mom was right. if you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.. shameful.	1
alleged? what's wrong with  ?	1
  oi foi saber 	1
    it's useful to have black ppl on their side to confirm racist views &amp; bash other black ppl	1
   she pushes the agenda and that's all they care about	1
  oh no why did she do that it's her buddy is she leaving the gop	1
"   don't bash her or anyone else for not returning $$ sooner. no box marked ""racist"" on contribution forms!"	1
  they donated because she saying everything that they are thinking so keep the money you fake	1
 she was surprised?	1
   xbz	1
   i'm not american so forgive me. how come a white supremacist was give money to a black woman's campaign	1
    clearly they felt her ideals represented their interests... which should serve as wake-up call	1
  smart idea now tell your party president cand's tedcruz &amp; mikehuckabee to be smart about the confederateflag	1
  what a shameful empty shell of a human. taking $ from ppl who revel in oppression/marginalization of your own race.	1
  the presidential donations were reported by the guardian on sunday. holt gave $1,750 to paul and $8,500 to cruz's	1
 what a hypocrite. she's returning the money now as it came to light. wasn't someone checking donars?  	1
    whatever 🔚	1
   too little too late!	1
"   i'm racist so i'd like the us gov to return all my money back that i've ""donated"" over the years."	1
  imagine that...	1
   do you know who's giving you $$'s	1
   unacceptable. guess if charlestonshooting hadn't happened the supremacist's dollars would have been kept	1
   so scary but true!	1
    nope makes them feel like they can still purchase negros	1
  a black, female republican.., no such thing!	1
   they should take that money and donate it to the black churches of charleston	1
   their skin color doesn't matter...gop leaders are  blood suckers charlestonstrong  takedowntheflag	1
_scholar _marit    christians aren't big on remembering their own history. or trying to learn it.	1
  take the money and run!!	1
   black on the outside white on the inside?	1
   claytonbigsby is up to it again 	1
    because her conservative views are probably some what like his kinda. as crazy as it sounds.	1
   great that she is but would she and other have if the terrible event in sc had not took place	1
   she knew what this guy was about before accepting his money. her gesture to return it means nothing.	1
   i'm not understanding how you don't know where donations come from anyway.	1
   excellent nice looking nicely mega top model ideal women	1
   this makes no sense.	1
  how is she even in the republican party? and why?	1
 passports are real. raw material for new identities.	1

_mckernan      sorry if u felt attacked, i meant the comment of mark above me who seems to think a person tweeting about her scientific work has to discuss it in the twitter feed. i‘m sure she’s discussing a lot with her colleagues. + she even entered some discussions in the comments.	0
_mckernan      i can’t answer for her but ask urself is twitter the right place for a discussion like that? there are science forums where al day long people discuss about the newest research. discussing work is part of science but not ob twitter	0
 _mckernan     if she doesn’t want it to be discussed, then why the hell doesn’t she solely use the “science forums”. it’s called social media for a reason. give me a break.	0
_mckernan      agreed kevin, i don’t understand this either.	0
_mckernan      we don’t see these effect in measured cases. see iceland which went out of their way to test all age groups and a very light “lockdown”. primary schools were still open and kids still less likely to get it which implies deans hypothesis is wrong. 	0

  mind boggling/just heard it this morning/he conveniently did not mention the adult males/why is he so focused on refugees?	1
  stop asking great questions!!! they're gonna call you a racist!!!,	1
 in pictures &amp; video of refugees. there seem to be more 18-30 yr old males than 3 year old children. pres has never seen the pics	1
 settle them in chicago. no guns there. its one big gun free zone...	1
 get the1st div out of ft riley and surrounded mizzu with concertina wire.  put the refugees there.  it is a safe place after all.	1

 gonna be a lot of torches and pitchforks and looking for a scapegoat, when the consequences of their actions catch up with them.	1
 same. except there’s been a slight shift towards accepting it — and more discussions now of who’s to blame (following the potus’s racist lead). the shift from denial to pitchforks was only a matter of time. it’s beyond horrifying.	1

what is herdimmunity threshold for covid19?a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp; huge consequences for long term impact. new paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially (spoiler: we still don't know value). thread.	0
human populations are not well-mixed &amp; homogenous, so calcs give likely upper bound. q: so what is herd immunity threshold (hit) for real pops?a: *usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.	0
background: if we know reproductive number r0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (hit) for well-mixed homogenous population is simply 1-1/r0. (note r0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space).	0
1) if some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering hit. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).2) if some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces hit. 3)if some people don't transmit that also reduces hit.	0
positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.	0
however, see paper by  that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than science paper cited above. fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects hit, f, for r0=3; so hit=0.66, f = 0.94. 	0
science paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces hit. it considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.	0
the strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. the citation they give is not a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ matlab files. it's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there.  can probably provide best ones	0
"the take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. not well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential ""activity"" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce hit for r0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43. "	0
the conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value. 	0
what i find puzzling is that this paper is in science. it's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. it isn't as general as  paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. many older papers say same thing.	0
 paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on hit, f based on data (colored lines in figure). 	0
in idealized population, early vaccination to hit will prevent outbreak b/c rt=r0*s/n so rt&lt;1. however, an epidemic will overshoot hit &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*r0)). for r0=2.5 (reasonable for covid19 in some pops), hit=0.6, and f = 0.89.	0
these simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led  to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70% of pop would get infected without interventions. most articles cited the 70% *but*  knew that...	0
i'd like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. but ...	0
serological data from nyc suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or r0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20% - i added horiz dashed line). 	0
together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;1-1/r0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1-exp(-(f*r0)), but by how much is still unknown. ugh.  smartly gave a wide range 40-70% (20-60% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions.	0
unfortunately, uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for hit for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does r0). the take home message is want to get to hit by vaccination not infection.	0
 are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from hiv or stis with highly stratified risk groups)?covid19	0
 yes. see link at end to interview with  that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial.	0
"  did some work on this in 2007 or so also when i recall correctly: “""a programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available."""	0
_leenders  this is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial).	0
  do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has, how long it lasts?	0
  not yet, sadly!	0

"  ""what is this about nerd immunity?"""	0
  assumptions about heterogeneity are just that, assumptions. but there is plenty of convincing evidence that slow down in spread is strongly linked to lockdowns; despite high levels of infection. thus heterogeneity is likely less than the models predict. 	0

q. how long does the virus survive on surfaces?a. [1/2] preliminary studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days but this may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).	0
q. is it safe to receive a package from any area where covid-19 has been reported?a. yes. the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods &amp; the risk of catching the virus from a package that has been exposed to different conditions &amp; temperature is very low.	0
[2/2] if you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. coronavirusreachesdelhi	0

_ci i mean... i am young and healthy it’s not my health that i am worried over it’s my mom who is old and sick. some people act like their loved ones are not old or sick. ignorant!	1
 exactly that! it's about protecting those who are most endangered by the virus. and protecting the doctors and nurses that have to try everything to help those worst cases.	1
_ci except the entire world doesn't get the flu at the same time, we just don't have the medical resources to fight this at the same time. people need to remember death is not the true risk.	1

_ci some people are saying that this can be human caused, or that there's many more people dying of other diseases, that other countries face worse problems.and all this can be truth. but it doesn't make this situation less worrying. people who ignores, they haven't seen it near yet	1

covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates. 	0

is covid-19 airborne??	0
 the cdc has stated it's potentially airborne, although i don't know if there's anything concrete	0
 the other two coronaviruses, mers and sars, i believe, were indeed airborne tho	0
 research so far seems to indicate the virus can survive up to 3 hours in tiny droplets suspended in air, making airborne transmission plausible. main form of transmission seems to be physical contact between people or transmission through intermediary of another solid surface.	0

would especially draw attention to 's comment “what is the trigger for reintroducing mitigation efforts?” grad said. “as you lift social distancing, you can expect a resurgence of cases as susceptible people are available and since we’ve not hit herd immunity.” 	0
"  ""since we are far from herd immunity"".... they need to emphasize that....."	0
  opening up doesn't need to entail rising cases. if you had really good control and have mitigation measures like mask wearing and good tracing, it should just decrease the rate cases are dropping.this presumption that rising cases and death are inevitable is not helping.	0
are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites.to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. 	0
how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.	0
however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. 	0
can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.	0
spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. 	0
do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.	0
the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.	0
although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. 	0
can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.	0
there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. 	0
can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 	0
does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.	0
who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. 	0
are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.	0
some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.pls don't panic people with fake news because it's not real all facts are in these threads 	0
 when can we expect the full results from this survey so we can interpret comprehensive results with proper context? or do we just wait for you to selectively release sections to support the most convenient narrative of the day?	0
lot's of folks claiming school choice only benefits the wealthy, but our survey of albertans would disagree. students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended every choice of education. the percentages were pretty consistent as well.education choice benefits all. abed 	0
 this is rhetorical of course because the survey was so inadequately prepared and questions so leading that it was a rigged method to gather the biased responses you wanted.	0
  there is a wealth of research evidence that shows, for example, the devastating effects of summer learning loss on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. having publicly-funded charter schools able to innovate and respond to these issues is making things better for kids.	0

  _yates_maths  _lilico  so ifs for ny state is around 0.8% and for the older uk population should be around 0.9%.but we have 60k dead (ft analysis) and 3m inferred by serology which is an ifr of 2%?what is happening?i have a theory...	0
_puck  _yates_maths  _lilico  correction, _  doesn't seem to attribute all excess deaths to covid 19 infections. a significant fraction may have resulted from indirect effects of the epidemic	0
  _yates_maths  _lilico  _ the acid test will be what happens to excess deaths after the wave passes. if it turns negative that will indicate some of the deaths were of people where their end was hastened by a few weeks. if it just returns to zero that will show that they were robbed of years.	0
  _yates_maths  _lilico  elsewhere, i have read that 40% of uk deaths are in care homes.but 400k residents care homes is only 0.6% of the uk population.what may be happening is care homes are a lot further along the road to herd immunity than the rest of us.	0
  _yates_maths  _lilico  if in a years time 80% of people in care and 80% of the rest of us have been infected, it will all come out in the wash and the ifr will be (probably?) 0.9-1% for the uk, but if right now we have - i dunno - 4% in the community and 20% in care it will artificially raise the ifr.	0

an openly gay man said that he and his partner met with pope francis a day before kim davis did 	0
 and there's no way the pope could bless them and say he's a man of god.	0
 the big news is that they met in a gay bar.	0
"jakaś zorganizowana akcja chyba... "":an openly gay said - he and met with pope a day before kim davis did "	0
_rdz  so do you think he needs man or woman for sex?	0
 what do you want a cookie? who cares who was first? did pope give the gay couple his blessing? and tell em to keep up the fight!	0
 it was an old friend of the pope who happened to be gay. vatican is trying to spin this as cover over secret meeting w/kim davis	0
 you're a trip.	0
 pretty sure his boss once met with tax collectors and prostitutes.  walklikejesus	0
 is this the catholic churches attempt to look neutral  when it comes to gay rights? cause i'm not buying it...	0
 bet kim ain't smilin anymore.	0
 and what does that prove or matter?	0
_krieg  because the pope loves all humans as does jesus even those we may disagree with that is christian love	0
 pour gas on the fire baby. just let it go... i've had enough of the gay talk	0
 show-offs!	0
 i don't get all that squeak! so pope can meet gay people, but can't meet kim davis? i smell hypocrisy or stupidity here.	0
 who cares?	0
 why did the pope even waste his time meeting kim davis?  kim davis should be back in jail, not meeting with the pope/reporters.	0
 no one can trust this pope. now we're sure.	0
 did he also meet an openly woman woman - maybe an openly man manwas the pontiff openly catholic?	0

first, what is a coronavirus? ulmer: this particular strain started in wuhan province. it traveled from animals to humans.she said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first.	0
panelists:beaumont public health director sherry ulmerbeaumont emergency management coordinator tim ocnashekbisd assistant superintendent of elementary education anita frankfrom beaumont psychiatric clinic, jason mensah	0
ulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in beaumont or jefferson county.	0
"she said she doesn't want to downplay the flu. with both viruses, the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised.""we're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu.""""if we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us."""	0
she notes because covid-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine.	0
ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in texas, but mensah says there are 51.ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold.	0
i'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. i know (thanks to thedaily i think) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia.so, mild is relative here.	0
ulmer said she's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine.	0
"she says that's why it's important to continue ""tried and true"" healthcare methods. wash your hands, stay home when you're sick."	0
"clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays.lysol, clorox and 409 are cdc-approved to kill the virus.""we understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours."""	0
feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread. he gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. he's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days.	0
ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. the virus is transmitted person-to-person. she says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets.	0
that's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing.	0
"ulmer said the health department is putting together ""soemthing"" so people know what the next step is if jefferson county has a confirmed case."	0
(i'm going to use tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.)so ... tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures. that includes limiting crowds, increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1/2	0
measures. i would like to add, as of friday, the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds. the comment was at this time, danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken. 2/2	0
"tim says ""we're not trying to scare people. there's a lot of bad information out there.""he encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on facebook or from friends and spreading it like it's a fact."	0
"""we would encourage people to be patient because it's a fluid situation."" - feldshauhe notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. however when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming."	0
ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. and several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them.	0
"""we are as prepared as we can be with the information we're getting. of course it's fluid, but we're accustomed to these types of situations."""	0
"reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.she said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are ""doing very well.""""for our children it sounds like god has smiled on us."""	0
"now talking about ""flattening the curve."" people are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.""this is not here today and gone tomorrow."" -feldschau"	0
"ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would ""tax our healthcare system."" should the city/county get there, it would have to look at ""alternative"" ways to treat people. she didn't expand on what those alternatives are."	0
she said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.	0
"""i we know that you're coming, the staff can be ready for you. they can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2"	0
"as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus."" 2/2"	0
"feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.""if we ever lose control, we're going to have a serious problem."""	0
"from comment section on the video: ""if this virus is just like the flu &amp; spreads like viruses do (airborne) i’m not understanding the panic &amp; closure of so many things? what is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don’t do it for flu?"""	0
"this seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments. someone simply responded ""yassss"" and another said people don't know what to do ""so they just shut everything down i guess."""	0

@_dedenne__   so what is your argument? by the data, i believe this virus is overblown and not much worse statistically than the flu. we have prevented herd immunity with quarantines, cost millions their jobs and livelihoods and killed thousands of elderly due to bad governors.	0
"@_dedenne__   oh really? trump did everything the ""experts"" advised - too much imo. what happened to states rights? this was a nyc and ny/nj state failure. that is where half of the deaths are from. 2 million cases is much less than seasonal flu cases (with a vaccine)."	0
 @_dedenne__  herd immunity is not sure.say it is there, you would have clogged the hc system with the sick as happened in italy.and is happening now in sweden which tried that approach and now recognize it wasn’t the right one.	0
6: how does covid-19 spread? a: we are learning more and more about how covid-19 spreads. evidence originally was very strong that it was present in the droplets of people who were infected. 	0
when those people cough or sneeze the virus can be transmitted to others who breathe in the virus or if their hands become contaminated with the virus and then they touch their face.	0
there is more evidence that the virus lives on surfaces for long enough periods of time to be transmitted up to several days later. people who have no symptoms are also able to spread the virus.	0
this is part of the reason it is very hard to contain and slow the spread of covid-19 without taking the current measures of social distancing. 	0
 i think some of the reasons for this has been a dearth of information about 5g. you could provide this.what is it?what is the g in 5g?why do we need it?who is paying for it?what will be transmitted over it?do you as a technical journalist think it is necessary?etc etc	0
  - the 5th generation of mobile network technology- generation- faster networks, more capacity, better support for iot devices- the mobile network operators (and eventually the users, through their bills)- mobile broadband, data logging among others	0
 but the true answers are boring: it's the fifth generation of mobile data network, being built by the carriers (ee / o2) to provide more capacity etc.	0
 what do you think will fill that capacity? why isn't this spoken about? the vision, the use of, the reasons why...	0
  there have been articles explaining all this in loving detail for about four or five years now ... but the anti-5g people clearly have been closing their eyes and/or don't know how to use google or bing.	0
_weber  yes, possibly there have...in terms of a bigger picture, why increase the capacity of a wireless network?for the layman?are you not interested as to why they spring up and become popular, these theories?just saying people are lazy or stupid does not cut it	0

" so, the who estimates that of people who get infected, 1 in 5 will need hospital care. so 20%  look under ""should i worry about covid-19?"""	0
w/coronavirus, about 20% of infected ppl end up needing hospital care. mi population is 9m. if 1% of the pop gets infected, as many as 18k could need hospital care.as of march 2 there were 6431 free hospital beds in mi. someone pls tell me my math is wrong😳 flatteningthecurve 	0
 where did you get the stat that 20% of infected people need to be hospitalized? that seems like a high number.	0
 ok so i got some clarification - that’s 20% of people who felt bad enough to get tested. many more people are walking around with covid-19 and either don’t know it or aren’t getting tested. so the numbers are a little better that way...	0
 that would be a lot better! is that on the who site?also, that 18k number is assuming 1% of the population in mi is infected. projections/estimates are as high as 40%. italy has just 17k positive cases and it's overwhelmed the system, where the bed ratio was higher than here.	0

breaking: ontario confirms 38 more covid-19 deaths, adds 514 new cases 	0
@_kjkelly  i'm not at all suggesting that covid-19 is just like the flu. it is clearly worse both in terms of transmission rates (r0) and mortality rates. but these charts are trying to show how it's an order of magnitude worse. even with seasonal flu vaccine widely administered.	1
  yes, they do, though it is incomplete and provisional, as it can take months for all of the death certificate data to the cdc from the states. here is chart of weekly pneumonia deaths  through april 4. pneumonia deaths are spiking, as one would expect. 	1
  source: data for the week of april 5-11 is vey incomplete, so not plotted. it's already high, however. 	1
@_kjkelly  so week of feb 1 total deaths 56589 (0 covid-19); week of april 4 (highest covid-19 deaths, 5457) total deaths 52992.so while covid-19 ramps up the overall death count drops?	1
 @_kjkelly final orders of magnitude won't be known for a long time. so much under counting of cases/deaths it's hard to tell and without testing everyone it's impossible to know for sure. it could still end up 5x or 10x worse than seasonal flu at the end of the day.	1

  lot's of hospitals do.  however, what kind of hospital puts an isolation mask on someone with  covid19 symptoms?  most hospitals immediately put patients with those kinds of symptoms on o2 (i.e. non-rebreather).  she must not have the symptoms (low sp02).  could be psychogenic.	0

 sing it anyway. they’re not compatible chants — sign on gets sung {inaccurately sung in a lot of places} because ynwa is a such fun song to sing. churlish not admit that most neutrals watching the 4-0 barca game aren’t envious of being a part of that level of connection.	0
 i mean an all encompassing ‘fun to sing, meaningful, world famous song that spills over and is mentioned in other sports’ kinda way. sign on has been sung for decades and it’s so old now that the lyrics {before covid job losses} are out of date beyond all recognition...	0
 it doesn’t wind scousers up, it just’s just funny when people from burnley etc sing it to them. i almost pity rival fans who sing it. so to that end, i honestly believe that it’s just sung because they hear it at anfield and dortmund and celtic etc, and vicariously want in.	0
how does covid-19 spread?initially, experts believe the virus started out in animals in wuhan, china; and was then transmitted to humans. the current version of the sars-cov-2 spreads from person-to-person, similar to the flu. this usually happens when a sick person coughs or	0
what is covid19?coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. they have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov).	0
in december 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in wuhan, china.the virus was previously termed “ncov-2019”. at the beginning of 2020, the virus was officially named sars-cov-2, due to its similarities to the previous	0
sars-cov. the disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the who as coronavirus disease 2019, or “covid-19”.	0
sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters).	0
what are the symptoms of covid-19?symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. but in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. symptoms can include:	0
• fever• cough• trouble breathing • feeling tired• muscle achesmost people have mild symptoms. some people have no symptoms at all. but in other people, covid-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death.	0
this is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.	0
when should i see a doctor?if you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to covid-19, call 937 (the saudi moh service center) immediately.you might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days:	0
• you lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has information about which areas are affected. this can be found on their website:  ncov/travelers/index.html	0
• you had close contact with a person who has the virus – this generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.if your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. they can tell you what to do and where to go.	0
if you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. the staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people.if you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead.	0
this way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.	0
"how is covid-19 treated?most people with covid-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. if you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""icu"")."	0
there is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions; and make you as comfortable as possible, this is done through multiple ways, including external oxygen	0
(e.g. oxygen mask), a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), and/or medication.	0
can covid-19 be prevented?there are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting covid-19:• wash your hands with soap and water often. wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to	0
the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.o if soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.	0
• avoid touching your face (including your eyes, mouth, and nose) with your hands• cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, and wash yourhands immediately after (as specified above).• clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and	0
surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.• cdc does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including covid-19.o facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of covid-19 to	0
help prevent the spread of the disease to others. the use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has covid-19.• stay home when you are sick, and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to covid- 19.	0
• try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.• some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of covid-19.if someone in your home has covid-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:	0
• keep the sick person away from others – the sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.• use face masks – the sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. if you are caring for the sick person,	0
you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. this is especially important if the sick person cannot wear a mask.• be extra careful around body fluids – if you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear a	0
disposable face mask, gown, and gloves. if any bodily fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.• clean often – it's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. this includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, tablets,	0
and bathroom surfaces. also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.• wash hands – wash your hands with soap and water often (as specified above)• you should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with	0
other people or pets in your home. there is not yet a vaccine to prevent covid-19.how can i prepare for a possible outbreak?it is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. the best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact	0
with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.if there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. if this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with covid-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.	0
there are things you can do to prepare for this. for example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. you can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.	0
this way you will be able to receive and share information easily.if you or others in your family are anxious about covid-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. while it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk.	0
where can i learn more?as we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself.you can also find more information about covid-19 at the	0

  with sticker gun laws and 123 shooting. i wonder why? protect 2nd amend.	1
  correlation is causation	1
  terror will continue to reign as long as good men do nothing. obama has to be a plant to destroy america	1
 _boyle1	1
  did they change the definition of mass shootings ? i'm sure this will be labeled workplace violence.	1
 i'd love a source on that. also, wasn't the awb during clinton and bush2?	1
 	1
 are you trying to say it's reagan's fault? 😱	1
  his legacy will be  alot of blood shed at home	1
 i am sure the hateful, divisive, us vs. them rhetoric from  wasn't a factor./sarc off	1
 obama = hate race religion gender himself?	1
  just like the stock market does better with dem president fact, this is merely coincidental.	1
  alleen de laatste doet er iets aan. dat is verschil en media duikt op alles!!	1
  what is the appropriate response to sabotage?	1
_50  lol. well...	1
  maduro ? fidel ?	1
  obama has encouraged mass shootings by politicizing them. also by being useless defending against terrorism.	1
 _texas if that is true, that is a crazy statistic	1
  162 of these were work related violence.	1
  enter in causalties of war. may even the playing field	1
this happens when congress blocks rational gun control. mass shootings boost gun sales &amp; nra lobbyists.  	1
  the entitlement of the right. have their beliefs and position questioned and they lose their shit.	1
 all a bunch of bs	1
  162, most of which were in gun free zones!	1

  because that evil, sick funk muslim potus likes it !	1
  its hard not to give excuses to anyone, but social cohesion must be part of it. obama divides.	1
 nice visual!!	1
  he's a muslim	1
  and yet liberals continue to support our dick-tator in chief. this is not coincidental but orchestrated.	1

  ovamit's climate change - disarm america and let the terrorists rain bullets and bombs.	1
  thank you for this, i was going to look this up. i knew it was much higher, but had no idea it was this high!!	1
   it's still all the fault of pres. bush	1
  out of curiosity, what's the source of those numbers?	1
  wow!	1
 what variables are you comparing? statistics are pointless without meaning?	1
 p-value less than .05, i believe there's a significant difference.	1
  the common denominator is obama when it comes to death in america when he is gone we can begin to rebuild usa♥	1
  so it's obama's fault people are insane?	1
  very interesting. a breakdown by race might explain some things.	1
  i'm thinking poor real economy colliding with entitled kids + social media = an abundance of a**holes	1
_cards   why the increase under o ? o &amp; his injustice dept. will not pursue death penalty for punishment of criminals	1
 _ what analysis	1
 _c_meyer   cause there wasn't much social media like there is today	1
 global warming has gotten worse. i'm sure that's why obama's number is so high. right?	1
 what would they do if we said we want to keep our guns to combat climatechange and the madness it's creating?	1
  do not be deceived. there are 2 possible motives. 1) gun control 2) police state	1
  obama is bad omen	1
  a pertinent comment on the increased violence under an islamic-inclined president, 	1
  by the numbers islamist muslims kill obama faith deadlier then obama !	1
   not surprising - those presidents had a gun control act which was struck down in 2008 tcot	1
no, cultural rot &amp; o works to disarm law abiding citizens while making others soft targets!   	1
 hey i'm starting to see a trend there with those numbers. can you spell democrap?	1
 according to liberal math there's been 352 this year, so it's even worse if you add murdered feelings. liberallogic	1
"    more than an ""omen"" he is a puppet of evil - pure n' simple."	1

  …… oops. the relevant number? gun homicides annually.  …. dropping steadily.	1
 _texas ok, but what are the golf handicaps of each president? only stats this idiot is interested in!	1
 i'm waiting to hear pres. obama spin the mass shooting stats [on his watch] as caused by climatechange.	1
 almost all after changes in expanded definition, and increase in more restrictive laws. thanks libs. i'll keep mine thanks.	1
  boy this info is enlightening. the most divisive president in us history has quite a legacy with this stat.	1
  is there a democrat problem?	1
  _suis_liberte go back to your safe zone. we'll take care of everything. as usual.	1
    seriously we have three guns and i don't. ammo is expensive.	1
  wow it's interesting how global warming has driven islamic terrorists in america &amp; our president mad.	1
  right on plan to destabilize the nation.	1
  interesting since reagans time, the numbers have unfortunately increase, why?	1
  _suis_liberte channa, when you call the police do you tell them to not bring their guns? don't be a hypocrite	1
  not over yet,still counting ...✏️	1

sunday psa, please read and share.what is herd immunity in ontario for covid? based on  calculations, about 2.1%  with only 1 in 11 cases of covid detected.only 2.1% of population has had exposure = no herd immunity and must be careful!!	0
perhaps you think these calculations are theoretical and don't matter. but they align very well with what swiss researchers have found-- 11.6 cases for every 1 case detected. most of the population of geneva remains unexposed despite large case number. 	0
please--wash your hands, wear masks, keep as far away from others and limit interactions. all these actions will help to keep you, your family, your neighbours, and our healthcare system healthy!!	0
so children are usually considered 'vectors of disease' and everyone believes that kids spread germs. but is this true for covid? could it be that kids are not the superspreaders we think they are?summary work from irish health technology group here...	0
....and a link to the report they have published here 👇	0
what's going on with younger kids? are they breathing less volume on people (yes, they are smaller)? talk less forcefully? do they have less prolonged interaction with others compared to older kids? or is there something fundamentally different in their immune response?	0
well it looks like policies aimed at kids may have a lesser impact on transmission of coronavirus infections. implications for school openings. 	0

"  under the ""how long is the incubation period for covid-19?"" section?"	0
  you do realise that it takes at least 2-3 weeks for any measures to make a difference right?	0
  ok, another twitter expert it seems. have a word with the cmo, he’ll probably be well pleased with your input	0
  aren't you the twitter expert? you clearly think that you know better than the science supporting the action of governments globally?	0
  no. i observed that the measures italy have put in place havent seemed to have made a difference. i haven’t made any statements about how long measures take. you have.	0
  ok well you should probably read this  then you may learn why they are having such issues in italy.	0
  that’s virtually the same advice on the gov website. it’s just a q&amp;a. it doesn’t explain “why italy are having issues”	0
  as i said incubation period is 1-14 days. italy has been locked down since the 9th march (13 days) there will be cases coming in since before that. people won't be in hospital from day 1 of symptoms. time delay is the killer here. by the time it's visibly bad it will be too late.	0
  ah ok. and where can i find all that information on the link you gave me?	0
  right ok, so if the measures in italy are successful then the death rate should be falling drastically over the next 2 days?	0
  hopefully... although you would also need to know how long people are showing symptoms before they die. point is we can't wait and need to try everything we can to stop the spread. otherwise the nhs will be on its knees. italy has more hospital beds per capita than us.	0

brain teaser: assume that 5% of the population has covid19 antibodies, and the serology test has a 95% accuracy (specificity=sensitivity=0.95). what is the probability p that i have antibodies if i test positive? (for bonus points explain your answer in comments)	0
 not needed to respond the teaser.	0
"  hence the answer is the ""tricky"" d) (which i did not get, because i wasn't watching for strict inequalities and thought i was picking ""greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95"")"	0
 0.5 if you are a frequentist. if you are an hypochondriac bayesian and you work in an hospital with covid-19 patients, i.e., p(antibodies) &gt; 0.05, then the probability shifts towards 1.	0
 if you apply bayes you get the same result. of course, things change if you change the prior, but that is unrelated to frequentist vs. bayesian.	0
 hint: thomas bayes would be of great help	0
 strict inequalities.	0
 prior and likelihood neutralize each other exactly	0
 p(covid=y)=0.05 p(test=y)=0.095 p(test=y|covid=y)=0.95	0
 p(covid=y|test=y)= p(test=y|covid=y) p(covid=y) / p(test=y) ; 0.95 0.05 / 0.095 = 0.5	0
 i'm taking my chance and not reading the other replies beforehand. it's 50/50! 😱 we have two random binary variables: tst (good test) and atb (antibodies present). plus one observable: res(ult). given same specificity and sensitivity, we can assume both vars are independent (?)	0
 thus, among four possible combinations of tst x atb, we have two that lead to res=positive, i.e., (tst and atb) or (not tst and not atb). p(tst,atb)=p(not tst,not atb)=0.0475. so, 50/50 between these two possibilities.	0
 50% 	0
 400 person trial. 20 are positive. 380 negative. 361/380 of the negative test negative. 19/20 of the positive test positive.  but 19/380 negative test positive. any positive test is 50/50 a true positive or false negative.	0
 if i test positive i am either a fp or a tp. the number of fps is the number of negatives (95% of pop.) x the chance of misclassifying them (5%). the number of tps is the number of positives (5% of the pop.) x the chance of correctly classifying them (95%). hence, p=0.5.	0
 cheeky answer categories! i'm always entertained by how similar bayes' theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other.	0
 50% 	0
 one of my first go-to questions while interviewing data science candidates	0
 true positives (tp): .95*5%false positives (fp): .05*95% =  tpp = tp/(tp+fp) = 50%	0
 but, here is the issue. i can say i have a magical prediction power. simply, i predict a negative result for everybody. and i win over the lab test.... but i have zero sensitivity!	0
 none of the above. it is 50%	0
 =50%. could use bayes, but ppl don't understand that so do example:   suppose 10k ppl tested.  at 5% incidence 500 have antibodies, 9500 don't.  .95*500 = 475 true positives.  0.05*9500 = 475 false negatives.  fn = tp so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0.5	0

who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. 	0

 the virus can be transferred thru droplets. it can be transmitted through aerosols, if you’re in the same room as some1 &amp; they are breathing the same air, you can get the virus (masks &amp; eyewear are key). it can be transmitted through urine &amp; faeces - don’t use public toilets.	0

how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.	0
coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)	0
and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). the most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease covid-19.	0
what is covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.	0
symptoms the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they	0
eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?”	0

 you are right on.  given the current burn rate, developing a strong public health response that makes reopening safe and helps limit future lockdowns...it’s money in the bank.	0
  can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?yes! read this from who. wear a mask! everyone should! we protect each other  	0
i spoke with  late last night. he’s donating hundreds of ventilators to new york city and state, including our public hospitals. we’re deeply grateful. we need every ventilator we can get our hands on these next few weeks to save lives.	0

jaap van dissel presented the following (figure 1) that outlined the strategic options that were considered by the omt.figure 1, the 3 conceived covid-19 pandemic control strategies 	0
the three considered strategic options:1. no interventions, a worst-case scenario, where the virus is allowed to spread freely (red);2. maximum control, a mitigation scenario, where social distancing decelerates the spread (green);3. lock-down, a containment scenario, where..	0
mandatory isolation diminishes the spread (blue);had been evaluated using a model, for which to date no source code or parameters were made public. the lock-down scenario is kind of odd, it would have been expected that the post-maximum slope of this curve would be ...	0
significantly steeper as compared to ‘no interventions’ curve. surprisingly, here the slope is even shallower than the ‘maximum control’ slope. this suggests there is a feedback present, which decelerates the spread, in the model used to evaluate these strategic options. 	0
simplified epidemic modellingepidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease, a one-way transfer is considered, where persons transfer from one bin to the next. the rate at which persons transfer is described by ...	0

3. infected: persons that can spread the pathogen;4. recovered: persons that have recovered, i.e., immune;figure 2, seir model containing four disease stages. 	0
the transfer rates govern how long a person remains in a specific disease stage, e.g., the duration of the infectious period is determined by parameters %delta and %gamma. such a disease model does not directly consider adverse effects a disease may have, ...	0

scenario discrimination. such a parallel route, if it runs via asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, could provide for a path to recovered and therefore immune persons. the other route is comprised of symptomatic persons, which may require additional care. if the ...	0
symptomatic persons are in their ‘infectious bin’ for a longer duration, as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly, i.e., a huge dampening effect. as the pathway through ...	0
asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic dominates over symptomatic persons.this parallel seir model, when applied to the covid-19 data available from wuhan (narrow spike), would yield the following conclusions about the virus:	0
1. was highly infectious (most infected people where not on the radar in wuhan);2. could not easily be contained.figure 4, idealised seir-tti model. 	0
unfortunately, the parallel seir model is in a sense equivalent to a seir model that allows for track-trace-isolation (tti) shown in figure 4. ironically, that is what the chinese actually did, they aggressively tracked, traced, and isolated infected and suspected persons. ...	0
this essentially halts transmission, the ‘exposed bin’ is kept (nearly) empty.when the seir-tti model is applied to the wuhan data this would yield the following conclusions about the virus:1. was moderately infectious;2. tti was very effective.	0
the suspected actual used model is more involved, as it is comprised of several age levels, e.g., for each age cohort a more detailed seir-tti equation is applied. when age separation is considered it may have appeared, based on wuhan data that herd immunity could be build ...	0
relatively cheaply and quickly by keeping younger people at work (as the r0 would be hugely overestimated, while the severity of the disease was hugely underestimated), while vulnerable people kept home. a costly mistake as it has turned out.	0

what is a coronavirus?coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers, sars and now, covid-19.	0
what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 1/3	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3	0
how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	0
can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2	0
however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0
what are the symptoms of coronavirus infection?according to , it depends on the virus, but common signs incl. respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath &amp; breathing difficulties.in more severe cases,it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome..	0

q3: what is serological antibody test in the context of covid-19 or sars-cov-2?a3: blood is taken from the veins and the serum/plasma put to a test to know whether the person has developed antibodies against the virus, sars-cov-2, for the disease, covid-19.	0
q4: how long it takes to give the result of the serological antibody test?a4: it takes 15-30 minutes to get the result of the test. so, it is a rapid diagnostic test (rdt).	0
q5: who would have developed antibodies against sars-cov-2/covid-19? a5: only people who were infected by sars-cov-2 and had the disease covid-19 are likely to have developed antibodies against sars-cov-2/covid-19.	0
q6: why is the test conducted on population who are not known to have covid-19?a6: some people might have been infected but were either asymptomatic or were with symptoms but have not been tested. hence, the test is conducted on population who are not known to have it.	0
q7:  why the test has been initiated in bhubaneswar, not in other cities of odisha?a7: as bhubaneswar has been declared as a hotspot and there is likelihood for the rapid spread in the city and from the city to other cities, the test has been initiated in bhubaneswar.	0
q8: what is the purpose of the test?a8:  the purpose of the test is to help in disease surveillance. it will help us arrive at an estimate of how many people from different categories of population in bhubaneswar that might have been affected.	0
q9:  apart from random sampling for testing the population, who else can go for the antibody test?a9: samples of people with severe acute respiratory infections (sari) and influenza like illness (ili) are also being collected apart from random sampling of asymptomatic people.	0

so another important data point to review each day is the percent positive of all patients tested, by pcr and serology test types. what is “percent positive”? out of the total number of missourians tested, it is the percentage that have had a positive test result.	0
for june 1, that percentage was 6.5% for pcr tests and 4% for serology tests. 	0
you can also find a table showing how many tests were done each day in missouri, and how many of those were positive. if you view that table, you will note that the number of positive tests daily has remained relatively stable, while the total number of tests daily has increased.	0
that means the percentage of missourians being diagnosed with covid-19 is lowering.	0

  _is so it's not true ????	1
  i thought the author bio seemed odd and the image from the video looked photoshopped but i was on a phone so not sure...	1
  _is national report stories are all fiction.	1
_is  definitely a fake since there's nothing in the uk papers about this whatsoever.	1
 _is and the bit about fappy! :: )	1
what?! hope it's a hoax! “_is graffiti artist banksy arrested in london,identity revealed| national report 	1
"_is  they had me going for a bit, at least until the introduction of ""fappy"" :-)"	1

_is  can't find the news anywhere else, i don't think it's real. read this: 	1
_is  nothing on website of either  or  - sure about this?	1

why are schools closing for a virus i literally do not get it...covid-19 is just like the flu why are we flipping tables and setting fires for a virus that’s gonna spread whether we can control it or not??	1
 honestly i am wondering the same thing??? and like it is stressing me out that all these places are closing for what	1
 it’s blown wayyyy out of proportion, i get trying to protect those who aren’t able to fight off a virus like it but the rest of us will be fine it’s so ridiculous🙄	1
 i 100% get that!! but when you think about the flu or other viruses that are close or just as likely of killing someone with a suppressed immune system why weren’t we freaking out about that? idk it just seems so blown out of proportion :/	1
 to attempt to keep it from becoming like it is in italy rignt now. hospitals are overwhelmed there. even though only 20% of the cases are hospitalized it’s still like 20 admissions per day. they had 300 cases just a week ago. it’s not super deadly but super contagious	1
 i think instead of closing they should just let people who are not healthy, old, immunocompromised, etc, leave and stay home from things without consequences. it seems much easier to do that than close everything for everyone	1
 it is being blown out of proportion. i think because there is no approved vaccine yet and it is seeming to spread pretty rapidly so it’s easier for panic to ensue.	1
       what is your point? your article refers to cdc serology antibody testing when active cases (what the states are reporting...people who are currently ill) are diagnosed with the nasopharyngeal swab pcr test.	0

can eating garlic help preventinfection with the newcoronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.	0

 who: “can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?“studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.”	0
among the unknowns re covid-19: how airborne is it?	0
 not very much. thought to be “spray” if through the air not floating around the same way influenza does. most common route is thought to be touching things then your face.	0
 it can be detected in aerosols three hours later, according to a preprint. so that’s a concern. 	0
 bottom line: yes it’s possible to contract covid-19 from the air, but that’s not the main concern.my coworker’s mother has been hospitalized for six weeks in wuhan. her caregiver (husband) didn’t contract it despite sharing air.	0
   the who says this how long is the incubation period for covid-19?the “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. most estimates of the incubation period for covid-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around 1/.	0
 this is what we seen in china	0
   people just walking and then collapsing?	0
   i am in self isolation from trip to italy but 2 days left and it will be 14 days since we got home. we are not sick just wondered could we still wake up tomarrow sick and collapse?	0
   five days. these estimates will be updated as more data become available	0
   yes however there have been cases recorded that are longer than 14 days. i would trust who they said the death rate was 2% and have now changed it to 3.4%	0

 that's what i dont understand. if nyc is saying 25% of people have had it (or whatever), what is stopping the other 75% getting it (or at least 35% before you get herd immunity) &amp; dying at a rate of c0.7%? there is zero logic to it, unless you believe the serology number is wrong	0
fyi those engaging with my tweet re nz: i am very convinced by prof michael levitt’s logic in this interview- it’s a must watch.   	0
key takeaways: covid infections are never exponential and infection rates start to slow quite quickly after a proportion of the population become infected. this suggests very strongly that immunity is being conferred.	0
 mmm - feels like he is betting the farm on the fact there will be no second wave. if he's wrong, it's absolutely horrible.	0
 well, the pattern of each local epidemic since the first 2 in china, on to south korea, iran and italy have all been very similar. i think it’s very safe to assume that a population which has had that level of exposure of a london or new york won’t have a “second wave”	0
 nothing. did you listen to the whole interview? the slightly unpalatable truth is that there is a minimum level of infection and death needed to confer immunity in a population. he quantifies it as 4 weeks of “excess deaths”	0
 here he was on march 30 telling us new york had turned the corner. 	0
 serious question or have i missed something?	0
everyone with covid-19 diesthis statement is untrue. as we have mentioned above, covid-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people.	1

 yes, although the article notes that 42.4% is still quite some way from herd immunity. also, it hilariously mentions that the low rate of hospitalizations is due to the tough mountain spirit. 	0

  _law what about:washington state = rosepedals = citizen (person)stem = government (people)united states = rose…north america = rose…world = roseeach pedal has its own needs (notice they don’t all fall at once). to your point, there is a supply chain…at every scale.	0
  _law the original principle still applies. some of the roses (for you) or pedals, or cells will be able to adapt - others won’t - trying to make reactions go faster though, tends to result in a smaller yield, i think.	0
  _law almost all rose bushes can recover from mites, mold, and other vermin if they are properly fed and watered. their survivability is not an innate trait but an effect of the relationship with their environment/context.	0

 _admin  so the screening is restricted to checking temperature. i thought the team would be taking blood samples to test antibody for corona virus.	0

q: are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus (2019-ncov)?a: no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the 2019-nc0v is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should  not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. - 	0

2. what are the symptoms of covid-19?symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. in more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. more rarely, the disease can be fatal.	0
these symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than covid-19. this is why testing is required to confirm if someone has covid-19.	0

 possibly;  but one has to ask oneself what is different now from before.  the virus is no different.  large scale surveys tell us that not all that many in eg spain have had it [7%?] so herd immunity very unlikely.  maybe private social distancing is enough. climate?  unlikely.	0
this article intrigued me.    so, unless i have missed reading something important, the early release of lockdown is precisely what is going to put us into the worst of both worlds.	0
on the assumption that regulated social distancing has added to the economic cost paid up front, in that what we saw would not have happened with purely private social distancing...  if we release now without enough test trace isolate [sorry, very boring to continue to repeat]...	0
...then we'll have created a &gt; recession than needed for little gain, as we go back to a let the virus rip strategy.  what gain there will have been will have been purely about trimming the top off the 'curve' [ie reducing peak case load] and reducing mortality from lack of care.	0
 seems like a second wave is modestly unlikely... europe has returned without itsome us states have seen 'second wave' but really this is just first wave not properly reduced	0
 major unknown factor for me in this is prior immunity from previous coronavirus exposurei can't make the evidence and theory fit otherwise, and proper epidemiologists like  don't rule this out	0
  what have you read on that last point?	0
q: can eating garlic help prevent infection with 2019ncov?a: garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from 2019-ncovknowthefacts 	0
 it could help prevent infection unless everybody eats it, in which case any benefit will be lost.	0

9. sars-cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldall coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.	1
thread about some popular myths on corona virus1. spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyapplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. disinfect surfaces not skinthese cannot kill viruses within the body!!	1
2. older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risksars-cov-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. however, anyone with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.	1
6. cats and dogs spread coronaviruscurrently, very little evidence. however, in hong kong, a pomeranian whose owner had covid-19 became infected. the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus	1
7. face masks protect against coronavirusdisposable face masks may not provide protection. yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. thus viral particles can also enter.	1
8. hand dryers kill coronavirushand dryers dont kill. only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself	1
9-2. thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans.	1
10. antibiotics kill coronavirusantibiotics only kill bacteria and not  viruses.	1
14. thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusthermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonscovid-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.	1
15.  flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid-19as sars-cov-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.so please dont panic, follow the govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. finally dont forget to pray. shambho mahadeva🙏	1

"  guarda la sezione ""what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?"" nelle faq per il pubblico e vedi tutti i suggerimenti che danno alle persone per ridurre al minimo il contagio"	0
"  sì ho risposto in modo analogo anche io e concordo, ed è proprio posta male la domanda. cmq è ulteriormente complesso perchè nn è banale nemmeno dire che il consensus sia ""la vera scienza""."	0
"  la domanda secondo me è assolutamente legittima. non è che è posta male, ma indica davvero il dubbio che attanaglia molti. ""a chi devo fare riferimento?"", ""di chi mi devo fidare"", sono domande che si vedono molto spesso."	0
  la comunità scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi è ciò che va' preso per riferimento, non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalità. a prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza.	0
"  ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia. burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da 2 mesi. ""state a casa"" nn è un claim scientifico. e' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita. non è scienza /"	0
"  scienza è dire ""se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce"". il ""quindi state a casa a qualunque costo"" non è scienza."	0
  no. l'oms ha detto che stare a casa è il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi. non probabilmente. lo hanno affermato con certezza. ed è confermato dai numeri. non lo dice burioni, né nessun altro. lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanità.	0
"  cmq no, è scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa è uccidere tutti gli esseri umani. se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani. partendo da lì, possiamo capire come il dire cosa ""minimizza"" nn serve mai a nulla."	0
  quindi secondo te l'oms dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage? a che pro, se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chissà quanta gente è contagiata?	0
  se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio è l'isolamento sociale, se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione.	0
"  definisci ""migliore"". nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna, e invece quello dovrebbero fare. poi politica sceglie con loro zitti mentre si sceglie."	0
"  la politica anche è responsabile della ""intromissione"" degli scienziati, eh. se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico, te ne stai lavando le mani."	0
"  ancora, nn cogli cosa intendo. loro devono dire ""chiusura fabbrica impatta x su tassi di contagio"". poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no, dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi, economici e sociali, dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori."	0

   _maxwell_ what is herd immunity? herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely.	0
will you keep wearing masks and limiting your trips out until there is a vaccine widely available?	0
_maxwell_ yep. viruses don't disappear. just look at measles. controlled, literally no cases in western world until anti-vaxers. measles are making a come back. virus didn't disappear, just waited for stupid people to not vaccinate.	0
 _maxwell_ if vaccines work for the vaccinated, why does it matter if others choose to not vaccinate? if you're vaccines do not work then why bother with them at all?	0
  _maxwell_ seriously?  no medical knowledge at all, eh?  what about those who can’t get vaccinated?  what about those who choose not to?  we eradicated diseases until people got complacent.	0
  _maxwell_ plenty of medical knowledge here. i have reversed more medical conditions than most because i choose to be healthy. i make healthy choices. if you do not want to succumb to viruses help those who are sick get healthy. contrary to popular belief it can be done.	0
   _maxwell_ do some research in 2017 59 million people died worldwide. if you are conceived it is only natural that you will eventually die. no one is guaranteed one minute five years 30 years or a hundred years. that is life. the strong will survive. so be strong.	0

teman-teman, aku menemukan bahan bacaan yang bagus banget di websitenya who. tolong sempatkan membaca ya :)	0
 sickening	0
 can't believe it i was there less then 24 hours ago	0
what am i trying to say? everybody has their lane. that a particular trade is booming for someone you know does not mean it will boom for you. you do not know what they know. forget the glamorous results you see, people's secret efforts settles most of these things outwardly.	0
many times you see many people post their achievements and accolades on social media and you say to yourself 'why not me?' when will it be my own turn? do they have two heads? etc. no! nothing is wrong with you. just discover your own lane and press forward. you are you!!!	0
most people will not even write about their failures. i am super proud of my failures. i failed forward. my failures gave me more lessons and earned me the right and boldness to teach other people about business.	0
your failures are a plus. you learn never to do things that same way. reason i embraced the lean approach. i learnt how to start a business with a very little cost, validate and then grow it.  () is a clear example. i will tell the story some day	0
by god's grace (all glory to god), doing my entrepreneurship career has gotten me recognition home and abroad including from president obama through his foundation, the dutch government, the wharton school, ventures platform, embassy of ireland in nigeria...	0
others are regional universities forum for capacity building in agriculture (ruforum) - a network of 121 vice chancellors of african universities, federal government of nigeria, niger delta development commission (nddc)...	0
small and medium enterprises development agency of nigeria (smedan), embassy of france in nigeria, bank of industry, african entrepreneurship awards, morocco, and several others.	0
because of my work as an entrepreneur, i have had free, and i mean completely free trips to some countries in africa and europe. it looks like i am bragging but i am actually not.	0
there were times i applied for these things - put myself forward, pushed and pushed and i always got a no! for me to share one award, recognition or free travel that came my way, i may have gotten nos in a multiple of 10, if not 20.	0
there is a particular annual fellowship i have applied for every year from inception back to back for 6 times in 6 years. i will try again the 7th time this year and look forward to being selected. that is how it is.	0
you have to develop a thick skin to getting nos, see them as part of the process and forge ahead. you have to learn from your mistakes and pick up yourself quickly. you have to ultimately look for your own lane and run your race.	0
do not let anyone guilt trip you in believing that this life is a competition. we are not wired to do the same things. you also have to stay humble. little accolades should not get to your head. if it does, your dreams are so small. increase the elasticity.	0
i moved to another city and drowned myself in bishop david oyedepo's book - understanding divine direction. i tried applying for jobs during this period and never did i get one. see, i have a very great cv, good schools, excellent grades and awesome work experience.	0
as at that time, i had worked for an impact accelerator and consulting firm in nairobi, did a three year stint in two large commercial banks with several volunteering experiences.	0
the first test invite i got, i passed and was asked to stay back for an interview same day. i was equally successful and was called to see the ceo which was the last stage of the recruitment process. maybe my price scared them, i was not called back as promised.	0
"the second one i ever got much later, i argued with my interviewer who felt he knew everything. lol. i didn't get both jobs. thank god. i am sure god was looking at me and shaking his head like ""see this boy i gave a master-plan trying to run the race of someone else""."	0
discover your own lane and that is where you will shine effortlessly. this does not in anyway downplay the part of hard work. you will work extra hard and even harder as you go up. succeeding is easy. staying successful is not.	0
that does not mean you will not celebrate your wins. celebrate them. enjoy them. but you know what, move on quickly and do the same things you were doing even more.	0
i have my story! you have yours! they are never the same even though our results might be similar. it could even bring us plenty money and fame. but it is never the same.	0
finally, success is not even about the money and the fame alone. it is about living your life in a way that you feel happy and fulfilled. only that, money makes the happiness and fulfillment sweeter. just find your lane, stay there and run your race. dazzol.blessed weekend.	0

contact tracing: fail.herd immunity: fail.ppe: fail.testing: fail.lockdown: fail.care homes: fail.contact tracing, again: fail.this government has presided over a serious of failures so catastrophic that it should trigger an overhaul of how things are run in this country	0
_watchman  why?	0
_watchman  60000 dead. you okay with that?	0
_watchman   herd immunity has nothing to do with genetics. other than the fact that viruses can rapidly evolve and make it it not happen.	0
"_watchman   it is entirely possible to be a tory (*shiver*) and see how this government has absolutely failed the british public. is your bar that low or are you blinded by devotion to ""get brexit done"" schtick? demand better, ffs. have  higher standards for yourself and ""great"" britain."	0
   what is the appropriate case fatality rate then?  1.4% is reasonable.   what percentage do you think is required for herd immunity?  even at 70%, the number dead is too high to contemplate w/o a vaccine: 3,2340,000.  	0
 herd immunity will arrive long before a vaccine.	0
  that would require 70-80% of the population to be exposed. and our healthcare infrastructure is certainly not prepared to deal with the consequences of that.	0
   and i doubt most of us are ready for the rate of death that would accompany that rate of exposure (3.7 million dead assuming a 1.4% death rate and 80% of us population exposed  [330 million x 80% x 1.4%] exposure)(is my math right?).	0
   1.4% is wrong.  furthermore, you will not need an 80 percent infection rate to achieve this.	0
"   ""what is the appropriate case fatality rate then?  1.4% is reasonable.""doubtful, because the true denominator is completely unknown.also, cell immunity appears to play a large role.  completely undetected through current testing."	0
   you just say stuff, but you don't read the source i supplied, nor supply any of your own.  and to obtain cell immunity, you have to have had the virus already.  that's what the 70%-80% of people exposed get, cell immunity, one hopes.	0

can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	0
let´s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. let´s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. so here´s a thread of q&amp;a on coronaviruses (covid-19) from world health organization.covidfreeaprilcovidfreephilippinescovidfreeworld	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3	0
how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3	0
can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2	0
however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

 omg, i don't think i've ever been so disappointed in someone i once held in high esteem. if 40 million get infected (based on flu numbers &amp; covid19 is even more contagious) a cfr of 3.4% would result in 1,360,000 deaths. not overhyped.	0
9. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
1. is it safe to receive a letter or a package from china?yes, it is safe. people receiving packages from china are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. from previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.	0
2. can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth).	0
3. how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.	0
4. can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation.	0
5. are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.	0
6. can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-ncov)?at present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. however, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.	0
7. do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop one &amp; who is in support.	0
8. does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.	0
who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.	0
10. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.however, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.	0

is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:1. smoking2. taking traditional herbal remedies 3. wearing multiple masks 4. taking self-medication such as antibiotics.	0

my grandmother watches fox so she thinks the covid-19 is “just like the flu.” it’s 34x more deadly, 148x more deadly to people her age. trump is waging a disinformation campaign instead of protecting the us. it’s infuriating.	1
 what a shame.	1
 it’s a shame for the people who will die or be affected by the economic fallout.	1
 i am lucky that my mama is right along with me, she gets it. she is frail, and i worry so much, but she is dug in, and is being vigilant. i reckon i can be grateful for that.	1

 _rdc  personally i am thinking it is, why else is it spreading like wildfire also it would have just been contained in wuhan.. i may be wrong but that's my view.	0
_jasper_88  _rdc yes!  it is airborne and much of the spreading is due to that. we're told to stay a minimum of 3 feet (~1 meter) from other people, and 6 feet is strongly recommended.  when you cough it easily travels 3 feet, 6 feet for a deep cough.  never touch your face.	0
 was he the one driving paul walker?	0
should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19.the mask can only be used once.if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.	0
the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms.	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.	0
is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019.however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.	0
is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.	0
can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.	0
is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:1. smoking2. taking traditional herbal remedies 3. wearing multiple masks 4. taking self-medication such as antibiotics.	0
in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreakthread	0

     what is the latest on the serology antibody testing?  as we now know, many ab tests are cutting edge, emergency use only, and many are not accurate (too many false positives).  what company and product is ohio using for the antibody tests that  mentions?	0
"    ohio separates this. confirmed = viral test. antibody tests would be noted as ""probable"" cases if they are linked to a positive case or had symptoms based on an interview with a health worker. ohio's ""total tested"" number put out each day does not include antibody tests."	0
      p.s. the better performing serology tests are now showing in other places (harder hit that oh), that we are not anywhere near herd immunity (spain ~10% infected thus far, sweden ~7% etc.). ab kits that give false positives for other coronavirus types will give false hope.	0

in the race to stop the spread of covid-19, some are wondering if herdimmunity is the answer. but what is that exactly?	0
here's what things look like now: 	0
for this to work, 70 percent of the population would need to have immunity. that's 229,767,666 people in the u.s. alone. 	0
scientists reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious covid-19 is specifically. this is called r0 value. it measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect. this is how covid-19's r0 values compare to other diseases. 	0
even though the numbers are high and it may seem simple at first glance, most scientists aren't onboard with relying on herdimmunity. why? this tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the u.s. and 30 million around the world. that's millions too many. 	0
until a vaccine can provide widespread immunity, communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable, especially heading into the fall, when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain. the alternative would be devastating.	0
experts also noted that by social distancing, we can mimic this tactic. staying six feet away from others also prevents the virus from bouncing to a new person.	0

here's what that looks like: 	0
i don’t understand how people can think covid-19 is just like the flu...it is a mutation that is only 3 months old and we have nothing to fight it with...there’s a reason that an entire country (italy) just shut down...this isn’t just the flu and to say so is completely ignorant	1

its not a bureaucratic issue. many of them r quite bright - its a political directions issue 	0
the real political decision to be taken is - how much and how to finance? how much - for india, anythng less than 3-4% of gdp wud be useless. tht's abt $100bn - shd be splashed out purely on consumption, income support and sme credit.	0
how to finance? good news - pvt investment is going to collapse anyway, so some headroom wud be there in savings. bad news - w/the lockdown, money multiplier⬇️-&gt; savings⬇️ -&gt; headline itself will be constrained. alternative - rbi buys g-sec. even deficit financing - its not porn.	0
there is the added benefit of lower oil - adjusted for $ appreciation + drop in demand - it shd still be a good $10-15bn. w/almost all our public debt financed locally, we have substantial fiscal policy freedom. time to use it for indians, instead of saving it for rating agencies	0
last but not least, stability of financial system has to be maintained. tons of tools in tht kit - but the real one is simple - prevent a bank run. there is an easy soln - for the next 6 mths, nationalise all bank depos. not the banks, but extend sovereign g'tee to depos..	0

  another way of saying that: look how many women have died since gerald ford was president	1
  wow... great achievement for obama.	1
.  libs keep touting that there's been over 300 mass shootings in us this year. wonder where they get their info.	1
  no, can't be.  sez only us has a pattern of mass violence. but this is guy who said isis is contained.	1
  those weren't pipe bombs!!! they were a science project!	1
  let's just build a wall around california, illinois, and dc and see who comes out on top in a year.	1

  and how many in america were gang related? bet a majority. but again libs do nothing about gang violence/crime.	1
    contrary to obamas declaration about it doesn't happen like this in other countries	1
  bullshit. rampage victims in america vs. overall homicides in a terrorized city? try comparing apples to apples.	1
  i was lking at the stats any the 1 i saw had every country with more ms shootings per cap had stricter gun regs	1
  oh but it is climate change and guns he will say.	1
  obama not having  facts or stats correct is nothing new for obonehead. he is a well dressed snake oil salesman.	1
  impeach obama! i know it won't happen. that would certainly fix a lot of our problems!	1

 and because he keeps saying things like that, there are still a lot of people that think that covid-19 _is_ just like the flu. they are unable or unwilling to think about the numbers.	1
“we’ve never closed down the country for the flu,” trump said last week. “so you say to yourself, what is this all about?”- president imbecile.	1

 and no-one's talking about warm, damp weather coming. we have frickin' open-air morgues now.	1
 he's been bad longtime. but after accusing doctors and nurses of stealing masks...that's it. no one can explain that to me.he is inhuman. subhuman. a demon.	1
with  reporting the largest single-day increase in covid19 infections, with more than 183,000 in the last 24 hours and the u.s. accounting for 36,617 of them, i seriously think we need to consider tightening publichealth measures again, otherwise we will never control this	0

  _europe     how to believe who?  see this january 15 info of who 	0
"   _europe     they can only go on the data that's available at the time. ""no clear evidence"" of something doesn't mean it's definitely not happening, just that they don't have scientific proof of it. the science changes as we gather more data - that's to be expected"	0
  _europe     it would be helpful if . didn't use double-negatives to get out important messages / notices. thanks.	0
  _europe     kind of a double negative here in your 1st post. are you saying it is ok to use ibuprofen?  the 2nd post makes it seem like you’re consulting physicians.	0
  _europe     i love ibuprofen. no one should ruin its' reputation :')	0

   _europe     thanks!many governments seem to taken for granted that is is harmful though, maybe is there no general agreement on this	0
  _europe     why do you use ibuprofen when it's not an antivirus.	0
  _europe     human pathogenic coronaviruses bind target cells together using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), which can be increased by treatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers. aka ibuprofen	0

  _europe     2/2 there is no evidence whatsoever that baby aspirin puts you at risk with covid-19.	0
  _europe     despite the double negative, if you read the entire statement the gist of the  recommendation  can be understood.  it is ok  to use ibuprofen if no other contra-indications exist. based on available information, this seems to be very reasonable.	0
"   _europe     ""based on currently available information.."" is unhelpful. it's a very broad okay for a very specific question. ibuprofen ibuprofene"	0
   _europe     it looks like a lab strain someone is trying to patent to have a science vendor sell. its an “attenuated” virus, meaning it’s a weakened form not able to cause infection. we need these types of things to make studying the virus easier in a lab setting.	0
  _europe     thanks for the clarity, ibuprofen is a commonly used drug so this helps	0
   _europe     but for me, my va primary does say to avoid ibuprofen &amp; naproxen sodium. check with your provider.	0

  _europe     we will use tylenol for now and not advil / ibuprofen just in case!	0
  _europe     our local media was saying different thing.	0

 i think public health england only approved an antibody test as suitable for use here today	0

  what will happen if we don't wear masks? probably acquire herd immunity in the long run and grow stronger, but that would come at the cost of the lives of elders and immunocompromised. look at what is happening in sweden. look at what happened in italy back in march..	0
  i dont believe the elderly are in any more danger than they are during flu season. we have been lied to	0
  what makes you think so?ok hypothetical question, if you believe that they are more in danger as scientific evidence was convincing enough to you. would you willing to sacrifice ur autonomy and wear a mask? or are you more of a believer in survival of fittest?	0
  survival of the fittest has nothing to do with it. we all look out for ourselves and our kin. if there was evidence that there is a deadly virus out there, killing left and right, we wouldn't need the media to tell us. if it was dangerous, i'd be doing the right thing	0
  the virus isn't deadly in sense of killing everyone sporadically, but it targets elders and hrg. it's nothing like flu which kills 600k out of 1 billion (0.1%) in 2019 where as as it has claimed over 400k over out 8 millions confirmed cases in 4 months only.	0
  sorry but i've heard all these arguments debunked numerous times that i wouldn't even know where to start. if you think this virus is so dangerous then i'm sorry but you've been had. false death certificates and people dying of other causes is just the tip of the iceberg	0

does this mean employers have to go through a redundancy process and then shout “psych! not really! gonna get a government grant, but you’re taking a salary cut”? again: what is the test for this? really interested in the details here… 	0
this is making some sense now: you send employees on gardening leave &amp; you get a grant for a significant proportion of their wages. then i think the vat deferral functions as a loan to bridge the period while the gov gets the structures to pay in place…? 	0
 i was initially “yes, at fucking last some assistance”, but now i’m not so sure. it now seems like it could be a load of hurdles (wages cover), and effectively a 0% loan (vat deferral) which isn’t nothing, but doesn’t seem super useful in the absence of a economic expansion.	0

 your thoughts- have we successfully achieved the original goal of flattening the curve? what is our antibody rate? what does it look like as we get closer to herd immunity? what would our numbers look like if our nh cases and deaths were at the national average? 1/2	0
 sorry, i don’t see part 1/2 in this thread or my replies…	0
 i’m no twitter expert.  i will try to find it.	0
 i think minnesota has probably “flattened the curve” so far — we never hit a point where the health system as a whole was being overwhelmed, forcing people to go without treatment. (that’s not to say that couldn’t still happen down the road.)	0
 i haven’t seen any recent data estimating the share of minnesotans who’ve been infected, so i can’t speak to antibody rates.mn’s nursing home covid deaths are worse than our neighbors, but middle-of-the-pack nationwide — way better than the worst states. 	0

so people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies (serology) from the total. is this consistent with what is being observed?covid19 9/x	0
a ubiquitous assumption made is, that at the start, all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as sar-cov-2. but is this assumption always correct?covid197/x	0
as a pandemic evolves, the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered. it is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease.covid198/x	0
most serologic assays have ranged from 1-3% all the way up to 20-30% in areas such as new york city. and the curve seems to be ending in nyc.  what gives?covid1910/x	0
similarly, in a recent study of an isolated alpine community in austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected.covid1911/x	0
it seems the pandemic has stopped in that community, with a high antibody prevalence of 42.4%. notably, children were less likely to be infected.covid1912/x	0
in another study, it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected, with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ace2 receptor.covid19 13/x	0
another fascinating study of a ship expedition to the antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected.h/t  covid19 14/x	0
so it seems likely we cannot estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific sar-cov-2 protective antibodies.covid19 15/x	0
how could this be? is it possible not all are likely to be infected? i suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical. i will share two possibilities others have explored.covid19 16/x	0
the most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human/primates/mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross-immunity derived from other coronaviruses.covid19 17/x	0
this is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure. perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past! thank you!covid19 18/x 	0
how could we be protected? it is impossible to tell. our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science.  maybe polymorphisms in receptors, immunity, or other ways. we might never know. but we do know evolutionary pathways selectcovid19 19/x	0
another possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. one such study has shown that as a possibility. they found t cell reactivity from viable t cells stored before sars-cov-2. in nearly one-half of cases!covid19 20/x	0
"this study was small but very provocative. if confirmed, this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the ""s"" (as in susceptible). in other words, you can be functionally ""immune"" even if not exposedcovid1921/x"	0
importantly, and somewhat obvious, they will not have typical sar-cov-2 antibodies. but they may still have protective cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses.covid19 22/x	0
it would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick. low hanging fruit!covid1923/x 	0
modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets (proteome) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies.covid19 24/x	0
it is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity. that would explain why there are clusters among families or friends.  and also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers.covid1925/x	0
globally we have heard from colleagues in peru, ecuador and greece saying “the parking lots were full, we had no more beds.  they are gone”covid1926/x	0
the problem is we have no reliable way of knowing who is susceptible, and how is not.  i do not recommend anyone reads this as a way to relax our safety measures.  but hopefully this give you hope.covid1927/x	0
 highly recommends i read the a camus book. highly descriptive of the current situation.covid1928/x	0
in the meantime stay safe, use masks in public, quarantine yourself if ill. and remain hopeful.covid1929/x	0

what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.	0
and have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003. this outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in guangdong south china.	0
it predominantly affected mainly china, hong kong, singapore, and taiwan. subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in asia, canada, and the united states.in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging	0
from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). the most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease covid-19.	0
what is covid-19?covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.openparlyzw	0
the best way to protect yourself against covid19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. openparlyzw	0
hand dryers are not effective in killing covid19 . to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. openparlyzw	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation.openparlyzw	0
thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. openparlyzw	0
however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever openparlyzw	0
spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). openparlyzw	0
be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations openparlyzw	0
do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus openparlyzw	0
are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).openparlyzw	0
however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care openparlyzw	0

it's almost like reopening public spaces while the pandemic is still in full force was a... bad idea? 	0
 bs stat. and the reasons the others have such fewer is because of the herd immunity that our leaders want to prevent by not opening up.	0

  who is full of china bullshit	0
but, sporting events, concerts, disney are all closed for a reason. covid-19 is just like the flu. realistically we will all eventually get this, just like we have all had the flu before. but this is a new virus that needs to be slowed down for our medical field to catch up.	1
tower thread - the fact people are going out to crowded public areas (bars for the most part) is mind boggling. yes younger people (under 55/60) are mildly effected for the most part (unless you have a preexisting illness). but any age is still just as contagious as the next.	1
you can have covid-19 and not show a single symptom. then go visit your grandparent/parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint. so many people are so uneducated on covid-19. yes the media has completely overblown this.	1
the only way to allow the medical field to catch up is social distance yourself. if you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly (e.i. china &amp; italy) causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with covid-19 that may or may not be in	1
a critical condition. on top of that that, it’s the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up, then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out. it’s not a beat it, it’s a slow it down.	1
as young people in society it’s our duty to slow this virus down. avoid social gatherings, avoid large crowds, wash your fucking hands, wipe down machines at the gym, socially distance yourself. if you have mindset of “i’m young, and this really doesn’t effect me”, then not only	1
are you being selfish but you’re the route cause for spreading. in 2 weeks, the people out in public crowds now are going to be the same people complaining when all nonessential companies (medical, emergency, food sources) are closed for 3 weeks to try and control all this.	1
"  sorry i didn't see your tweet earlier. this is what mit has to say. click link an go down list till you get to ""can i get covid-19 from airborne particles that end up in food?"" "	0

  it is honestly embarrassing how much hate this woman receives, and i really don't understand why. (i'm guessing racism and sexism play a part.)	0
    ..and your theory is based on said testing? please verify.	0
     it has been confirmed the virus cant stand heat.for the small cost of heating/savings from turning off air conditioning, life can be saved.the chinese dr.s that have beat this have told us vitamin c + heat kill the virus. it is relatively easy to kill as caught in early stages	0
     the human body is at a constant temp.. even when the exterior is hotter. so, 85° f would ( possibly kill of surface virus).. but you cannot increase  body temp 30°c ..without killing them ,  maybe  you can just pop them in a oven for a while ? lol...	0
     virus lives on surfaces such as tongue, nostrils, throat for a long time before it reaches  lungs. inhaling warm air such as in a sauna or hot environment would kill or inhibit growth of virus on these surfaces. sunshine, sauna, coughing out phlegm with the virus is recommended.	0
     sure. just take the stats from mexico. compare them to the stats on europe.	0
     it would be great if you could share a link to these stats. thanks	0
pope francis’ meeting wasn’t an endorsement of kim davis, vatican says 	0

 of course it was.	0
 right...	0
 but important point is that he met with her and not gay groups. gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage.	0
 it's rubbish. how cld it be seen as anything other than endorsement? suggests vatican didn't appreciate how far they overstepped	0
 sure, they just wanted to meet pure evil bigotry.	0
 it's entirely likely that he met her without knowing who she is: 	0

 in brazil this information is coming from blood banks, which test every donation. in rio de janeiro the antibody rate went from 4% in april to 14% in may, and 28% in the beginning of june.in the us the red cross should certainly have this info. why isn't it available?	0
  that's a great point!	0
 antibody tests are important if for no other reason, they still don't know how long the antibodies last and/or resist reinfection.  no one has yet to be able to answer that but i assume they are still testing to determine? who knows?	0
  my bro works for a biotech company who makes covid tests and because covid mutates so slowly (unlike influenza) there should be lasting immunity. which also means if enough people get it, it will fade away completely. just like sars and mers (both coronaviruses)	0
" because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunity's work. harris county's mask edict has just been extended until late august. by which time this would have been over any way. but now the can say ""see! look at what my mask edict accomplished!"""	0
  yikes. that makes sense. but it's so sickening in it's sneakiness.	0
 what about the cdc anti body testing done in late march/early april?	0
 in the early days everyone said this can’t be a hoax because the whole world is locking down. ok. fair. now flip the situation: why is only the us locking down (to this extent) again? 🤔	0

 alex, be careful with antibody tests. body deals usually so easy with the sars cov 2, that most of people don't even develop antibodies.	0
  is that when the often mentioned t- cells come into the picture?	0
 _law i'm not sure what you mean but maybe i get some of it? i believe that there are no coincidences ever. so how is it that all the events happening are right on time? for something. how can the virus do what it's doing very methodically and specifically at certain times and places	0
 alex, what's happening in nc?  i live here and all i hear is gloom and doom.  despite the numbers our own illustrious  dashboard tells us.	0
  great article! 👍	0
 new york city antibody results were over 20% two months ago. i would expect that they are much higher now, but there has been silence on that issue.	0
 assuming 20% positive on nyc antibody test, that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from nyc alone.	0
 my guess is the real antibody results in nyc are much higher, which is good news, not bad news, of course, because it leads to herd immunity.	0
" it's even more fundamental. ""novo"" wuhan virus found in waste water samples in spain - in early 2019. the whole fauci narrative was bs from day one.  the deaths are seasonal, predictable and many are the result of malpractice "	0
 it’s irrelevant because by fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero. they won’t be able to hide that glaring fact.	0
 i suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming, since it endangers the narrative.	0
 the cdc says for every 1 case we identified, there were at least 10 we didn’t.  fauci claimed yesterday the us would see 100,000 cases per day. do the math.  we have been well over his number for some time.  we are now identifying those by testing people who aren’t ill.	0
 and two months ago they said that’s what needed to happen, more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms.  now they are saying that’s bad bad because, well that’s a lot of cases.  i feel like we are being punked.	0
 nefarious? they want this to continue? or incompetence?	0
  pharmaceutical industrial complex	0
  has fda eua approved covid- 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities! this will help identify those with antibodies!	0
 antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around. talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry, molecular, or microbiology field, they will tell you the same thing.	0
" ￼""new research from karolinska institutet and karolinska university hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic covid-19 demonstrate so-called t-cell-mediated immunity to the new coronavirus, even if they have not tested positively for antibodies."""	0
 probably because they're saying the tests are inaccurate. 🤷‍♀️	0
  what are you referring to in nc?	0
 fredericksburg va this morning my husband was talked out of antibody test by doctor because she said they’re inconclusive and pointless.	0
 my wife and i did our part to reduce the death rate by surviving covid.  it wasn't fun but almost everyone who get it survives--including almost every person in the u.s. workforce.  have politicized covid because restarting the economy helps trump.	0
 likely adding the number of “positive  antibodies” test results in with the “covid positive” results.  it’s easier to fluff the numbers that way 🤨 cause it is “all covid” ...	0
  herd immunity will never be achieved for corona viruses. just like it doesn't exist for influenza viruses.it will or mutate and become part of life or mutate and disappear. my guess is the second one.	0
   it can’t mutate and disappear, bc literally natural selection. also coronavirus family don’t drift antigenically with a rate remotely resembling influenza.	0
 the red cross is now offering free antibody testing with a blood donation. hopefully that data will be aggregated and released.	0
 also, i look forward to seeing this one on  in two weeks	0
  well you live in ny - enjoy.	0
 while good news, think we’ve a longer way to go to get to herd immunity.	0
 alex, what’s happening in n.c. haven’t seen any stats. their website is not much help. no actual number for hospitalization and nothing about antibodies.cc:  	0
 the nc study is not randomized. these volunteers are self selected. i haven't requested an antibody test because i don't think i have had the virus. please stop calling it a randomized study.	0
 according to these swedish researchers antibody tests under count infected by 2x!  nyc could easily be at 60% if they are right.  	0
 what is happening in nc?	0
 it’s funny seeing people talk about the ins and outs of things like herd immunity and nucleic acid/ anti body test that probably never heard of any of those things 3 months ago.	0
 compare to other countries -- if we are so far behind then other countries must assuredly be ahead of us.i don't think it's that easy.   in the early stages the virus is too spotty go get a grip on it for something useful.	0
 dude are you arguing herd immunity is achieved at 30%	0
  nyc seroprevalence is around 25% and we see immunity playing a huge role. not abolishing the virus as herd would, but it’s ability to spread is extremely limited in ny.	0
 angry twitter man has found all the answers	0
  arithmetic has good reason to be angry with us all these days.	0
 and t-cell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies.  new york, italy, etc seems to show that we're nearing herd immunity, like it or not.	0
  not sure about doing things ny or italian style. they basically euthanized the vulnerable by using nursing homes for cv19 patients. mental midgets.	0
  hundo p	0
 i thought nih was doing this? i volunteered but apparently was not selected..	0
 madness, we are in the hands of luddites,  cretins &amp; covidiotinchief	0
 i think you are gonna be right.  or close.  but the evidence will be, i think, on worldometer or similar.  deaths for sure are way down.  let's see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon.  i hope so.	0
 we will not see a widespread, accurate antibody test because each person who tests positive is one less customer for a vaccine shot.	0
 um...no.i don't know if you noticed, but new york was a bit tense while all that was going on	0
 confirmation for all the “just wait two weeks” ninnies, karens, and npcs. they are gonna fight hard, but keep sharing the data. can’t hide from the truth:	0
 it could be that there are so many reliability problems with the antibody testing kits.	0
 what’s happening in nc? what did i miss?	0
 why is  not demanding this?	0
" another day another article. ..now they say test for t-cells and not for antibodies. .."" for every person testing positive for antibodies, two were found to have specific t-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.""do we know what to test ?"	0
 can you try to make these results available?	0
 and that would wipe out the pretext for mail-in voting in november.	0
 gotta make it last to november, then it will all go silent	0
" we don't know because the cdc is not treating this ""viral disease"" like a real emergency that requires excellent data and surveillance. they are treating it like a political bludgeon. clear data would hamper their mission."	0
 so what is the end game here, who is benefitting from falsely keeping us all in panic ? the only semblance of  malice i can think of is that some public health experts have a tiny bit more amount of fame.	0
   antibody tests that are positive for antibodies is like having your own vaccine on board.do more testing for antibodies, viral tests when symptomatic.covid19 covid19tx	0
_o_v_e_truth    can someone more well informed than myself please explain to me, if it's possible to have both t cells and antibodies present for the same pathogen? or do the t cells (if present) automatically override/ cancel out the abs?	0
 did you see this study from karolina ka in sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people don’t produce antibodies but produce an effective t cell immune response? 	0
  	0
  remember when birx said on april 1, 2020,”there is no more flu”. after that day any flu deaths were counted as covid. we stupidly went along and believed anything they said.	0
 meanwhile arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care. resources are being rationed and people are dying that could have been saved.	0
 might wanna do a bit more research on antibody testing	0
 you will never get that data. the last thing democrats want is the true on this hoax to get out.	0
 they want us wearing bacterial-laden petri dishes on our faces, to make us sick, so that in october, when we all have respiratory illnesses they can yell “covid! covid! see? its covid! no voting in person! close the polls”  	0
 _law so i heard someone on oan news said that the numbers of new cases are being cooked but my thought is what if it's worse than that what if they are using manipulated test kits somehow it's surely possible every other thing going on?	0
 this graph represents herd immunity.  isn’t this what we want? 	0
  of course, they can manage to produce tests that over report positives by 50% but not antibody testing.  it's like the media wants to propagate the scam, as if they have a motive to harm the leader of the country's popularity or something.	0
 the cdc has shown itself to be another incompetent, self perpetuating government bureaucracy.  random covid19 testing should have started in january 2020.   without random testing you have no idea of what’s happening.   the cdc is clueless.	0
 so let’s just let it spread and we will find out.	0
  hey! dr.  you retweeting crazy conspiracy theories is really going to help out  win those center moderate voters!  keep up the great work 👍	0
 i’ve been asking this the whole. it’s odd	0
" herd immunity would upset the plans; mail in ballots, fear for control, vaccines for all, contact tracing which really is the ground work for ""social score""; most of all marxist take over."	0
 they don't want this to end....anything to prolong the assault on liberties and freedom.....and anything to get rid of trump.	0
 what is happening in nc?  a little background of truth.  nc is just now starting to test nursing home residents and workers in the facilities.  just now.  50% of nc deaths are from nursing homes.	0
 looking at the real stats.	0
 _donga blame the idiot in chieftrumpkillsus	0
 if you are uncovering asymptomatic infections in a major way, we are closer to the end of the pandemic than most people realize. isn’t it the darkest before dawn?	0
  i hope you are right. i want this over. i can’t take it anymore. we are being scammed.	0
 the testing and metrics for case positive numbers are shit. positive because u maybe talked to someone with covid?????  this whole situation is completely fucked with a bunch of morons pointing to data that is worthless out of the gate. junk in junk out.  open the country now	0

hey , why won't you tweet a statement saying that you did not pay or compensate darren wilson for the interview? why silent? ferguson	1
 because  &amp;  stephanopoulos made a murderer even richer &amp;should hang their heads in shameboycotting abc &amp; advertisers of the show	1

   they probably had to pay him to even get him to come out of wherever he's been hiding	1
"  it appears  is acting as ""old media"" and that they only speak to ""real journalists."""	1
    this is rather clever, watch the wording of denial, push up the amount then deny it as ludicrous.	1
    they are not confirming.	1
   'cause they paid a murderer, that's why.😡	1

  guys, it was a honey trap!	1
 he just wanted an easy buzz	1
 why have i not heard of this, and i'm in sweden, and not even that far from ystad!?!?	1
 hard to beat. there are those who get turned on by having their own limbs amputated, luckily its a short lived obsession	1
  i would guess the hornets were just reacting to being poked. never poke a hornets nest, obviously you might get stung!	1
“: this is just about the weirdest fetish i've ever heard of. what was he thinking of?  wtf!?!?	1

 i love that the conclusion drawn by the sex expert  psychologist was having intercourse with a hornet's nest was ” a bad idea”!	1
  take away the pain, keep the swelling ;-)	1
"  ""wonder if i'll get hives"" perhaps?"	1
 it seems to as a fake article. as this ”neighbour bertil ståhfrääs” sounds weird. translated to eng bertil boner. 	1
 maybe he was just trying to get a buzz…	1
  but why did his neighbour weigh his scrotum?	1
  the neighbour's name is a sexual pun in swedish. it's a joke.	1
  its not real news... it was from a swedish satire site...	1
 i doubt that this is true considering the fact that the neighbours name is hard on in swedish :)	1
"  considering his neighbour's surname translates to ""erection"", i'd agree that it's a hoax."	1
 the neighbour's name ståhfrääs actually means hard-on, but spelled as if it was a peer's name. 	1
  actually it's not real, gotta understand swedish to get it ;)	1
  hmm, according to this, it isn't true?  but i don't know what their sources are.	1
 do you think it could be murder?	1

  it is not real mr. ståfrähs means having a boner.  :-)	1
  my good gods! this is not only horrible, but kind of stupid to boot.	1
   brilliant!	1

  a sting in the tail/tale, perhaps? x	1

      it’s used in emergency situations, and in combination with other drugs. the fda commissioner and cdc have both said it’s still in trials, but may work. my point is that saying covid-19 is just like the flu and we have drugs already is reckless at best.	1
      “the fda approved a drug that has no clinical trials nor proof of working for covid-19 so we’re all good” is a terrible argument.	1
      opium isn’t a new drug either. just because a drug has been used for one thing doesn’t mean it will work on another - and there is currently zero proof chloraquine will kill off covid-19. so assuming everything will be fine because of said drug is dangerous.	1
      it is an anti-viral drug with zero proof that it works on covid-19 at this time.	1
"      the south korean groups warned that there is ""currently no standard treatment for covid-19.”“patients showing severe pneumonia-like symptoms, high-risk groups including the elderly and the chronically ill, are target groups for a more ""active"" administration of the drugs.”"	1
      the treatments for a flu are tested for months or years - chloroquine has just started fda clinical trials for treatment of covid-19. i hope a treatment is found, no matter where it comes from. i just don’t like the hyping of a drug as the cure when it hasn’t been fully tested.	1

*can i catch covid-19 from feces, animals, pets, surfaces or packages?*🚽 *can i catch covid-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?*the risk of catching covid-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.	0
while initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.	0
because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. 🐾 *can humans become infected with the covid-19 from an animal source?*coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.	0
occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. for example, sars-cov was associated with civet cats and mers-cov is transmitted by dromedary camels. possible animal sources of covid-19 have not yet been confirmed.	0
to protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. ensure good food safety practices at all times.	0
handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.	0
🐶 *can i catch covid-19 from my pet?*there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit covid-19. covid-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. to protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.	0
"i'll add that i keep hearing this ""herd immunity"" deal. it isn't a thing yet, folks. but what is a thing is long-term lung damage after contracting covid. why chance it? as someone who suffers from asthma, i can tell you that constricted breathing for a lifetime is whack! "	0
  word!	0
 there are 4 other coronaviruses that give people colds. immunity from those viruses only last 3-12 months. so herd immunity may not ever be a thing with covid-19.	0
 exactly. we don't know enough about covid-19 to even discuss herd immunity, but most folks who refuse to accept this don't understand science so much. that hasn't stopped them from spreading disinformation that could prove deadly.	0

  _vetnar       we would love for everything to be open, so we can all go to a cardinals game or go out to lunch! but again, masks won’t stop the virus, just slow it. people still need to be vigilant and wear masks and social distance from others.	0
   _vetnar       there may not be any herd immunity. folks who have had it and recovered are getting it again. there may never be a vaccine if folks are susceptible to it more than once	0

update from mayor  on covid-19:-7 new cases monday, adjusted total of 473 known, confirmed covid-19 cases-riverside facility now able to test residents, frontline workers both with and without symptoms-regional approach to re-opening parks with 6 municipalities 	0
  very nice to expand access to testing in this way.  building on success with flattening curve in city.	0
   the curve is flat. we have a single digit daily case count for over a week in a city of 50k people. if that isn't flat please tell me what is?	0
   there were 84 cases last week with the revisions from backlog (week ending 4/25) — average of 12/day.  great progress, but more cases than the last week of march.  it’s a good idea to keep slowing it down before loosening restrictions.	0
     maybe so maybe no.  we have 473 cases in hbkn, with 19 deaths so a .04% mortality rate.  25% of nyc has antibodies according to cuomo, so around 2.1m people had it.  the mortality rate with 17k deaths is what, .008%?  they kept their parks open.  who did it better?	0
     if i were mayor, i’d be opening parks. doubt  that parks play any role in transmissions.  but i don’t have all facts, data, and expert advice.  i also think that it is one of the least important sacrifices of this very unpleasant period.	0

is it safe to receive a letter or a package from china?yes, it is safe. people receiving packages from china are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. from previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. 	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. 	0
can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).	0
be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. 	0
can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-ncov)?at present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. however, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.	0
this protects you against various common bacteria such as e.coli and salmonella that can pass between pets and humans. 	0
do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.	0
the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov. although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. 	0
can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.	0
there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. 	0
can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 	0
does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?no. sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. there are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-ncov on surfaces. these include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%	0
ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.however, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. it can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. 	0
does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov). older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to	0
be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. 	0
are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat	0
symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

it’s when a proportion of the population is immune to an infectious disease to stop it from spreading, eventually leading to it being eliminated. for rabies in dogs, we need to vaccinate 70% of the population to provide indirect protection – or herd immunity – and save lives. 💛	0

 good vdo but dear fakeera;autonomy of provinces under a leader like jinnah compared to autonomy of sindh under a crook like zardari are two different entities. its a double edged sword that has been used to kill millions of sindhis not help them. aziz memon's killers remain free.	0

   i am not here to advocate for  but zardari has a big carnage that is non-negotiable because pakistan has collectively suffered at all levels.there is absolutely no sympathy to be found to allow the devil to abuse 18thamendment @ cost of democratic rights of masses	0
    1) i don't support  2)  &amp;  are both separate entities 3) revoking 18thamendment is civilian movement to gain democracy back in sindh. 4) allowing zardari to continue to abuse 18th amendment against people is only making him more powerful	0
      zia died a long time ago. musharraf has no power right now. we are talking about what zardari has done in the last 12 years to sindh since the inception of 18thamendment. made sugar mills, diverted water towards sugar production, manipulated sugar price @ cost of farmers 4 $$$	0

 what is your take on the pre-existing cross-immunity idea and how it affects the herd immunity number?  some estimates suggest that 50% or more of the population may not be susceptible at all to covid.  herd immunity may therefore kick in much sooner in the us.	0
 agreed we are probably some ways off.  but then again, no one knows how much cross-immunity different populations may have.  is it 30%, 50%, 80%?  brazil seems to be doing the least to suppress it, so that may be one place to watch.	0
 _katie   again, what percentage do we need to be infected to reach herd immunity and what is the mortality rate according to you?	0
unfortunately high covid ’s are now baked in for next 2-3 weeks because they reflect infections 7 to 21 days earlier.focus now must be getting numbers to plateau &amp; start falling by mid-july &amp; preventing young &amp; healthy people from infecting those older &amp;/or at higher risk	0
 need to shut florida down... looks like he is in a race to catch new york.	0
 _katie   that’s completely incorrect. herd immunity for basic virus is 50-60% without vaccine.	0

   can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?”	0
   similar info on health canada website	0
   people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.	0
   other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.	0
   this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.	0

taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching covid19 .your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.  openparlyzw	0
hand dryers are not effective in killing covid19 . to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. openparlyzw	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation.openparlyzw	0
thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. openparlyzw	0
however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever openparlyzw	0
spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). openparlyzw	0

they also recognise that the huge improvements in contact tracing represent the justification for asking the public to surrender some of their rights.“successful and appropriate use of the app relies on it com- manding well-founded public trust and confidence.”	0

you will be used to seeing me complain that the state is doing data protection infringing thingsbut to be clear- i think a well designed and implemented app is necessecary and proportionate to our current circumstancesmy fear is that the gov are risking that aim with secrecy	0
and so, i find myself in the strange position of asserting that if the state has nothing to hide re it’s corona tracking app, it should have nothing to fear from letting everyone know all about it.	0
 as you say, currently we don’t need an app to track people we meet because for most of us they’re just the people we live with.the app is part of a toolkit to allow society to carefully try to restore some normality, even in the absence of a vaccine.	0

6.what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.	0
these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.	0

_javid_lab  _ie   _np2013   what is seasonality if not transient herd immunity? it seems to me we don’t really understand seasonality- but we guess it’s to do with temperature, sunlight or being outdoors. do we basically have a herd immunity threshold of 20% antibodies in summer, and 60% antibods in winter?	0
 _javid_lab _ie   _np2013   rupert when did you become convinced there would be a substantial seasonal effect? was it when lockdown releases failed to cause rebounds (as envisaged in paper 9)? if so what else do you infer from the non-rebounds?	0
 _javid_lab _ie   _np2013   convinced? not convinced, i just think it’s likely.	0
 _javid_lab _ie   _np2013   but why do you think it is likely? did you always think is would be seasonal or is this a new view based on the observation that the disease - according to the data - seems to be taking a break? if it’s taking a break why can’t we book summer holidays?	0
  _ie   _np2013   even back in feb i though it was likely to be seasonal, but i also felt unless we suppress aggressively, it won't make a difference: halving r to 1.5 is irrelevant if have 1m point prevalence. but seasonality and low r from lockdown synergise.	0
  _ie   _np2013   no, seasonality is about lowering average r due to factors that will include behaviour (less cramming together indoors), susceptibility (cold nose), viable virus longevity in environment etc.  not about antibodies (for common cold, v. short-lived immunity may also play part).	0
_javid_lab  _ie   _np2013   the way i think about it, individual immunity isn’t the only factor in determining the herd immunity threshold - susceptibility (including behaviour) is equally important or more so. if ppl have bad snot or cold noses what’s the difference?	0
 _javid_lab _ie   _np2013   behaviour... hard to model. maybe?	0

  _jaycee again, what is covid 19?  at this point seemingly the flu. recent antibody tests in miami dade alone indicate such.  not to mention the studies in santa clara and new york.  it's time we see we've been fooled. 	0
there’s a self sorting going on, and no government can stop it...those who wish to remain quarantined are, those choosing normal life over the risks are...it’s immoral and destructive to keep things locked down when there is no fear of a health care system...	0
 _jaycee as long as you return to your beaches in your state and stay out of my state will be good with the beaches.look at the i-10 corridor from texas to florida and you can see where the spring breakers and vacationers came through in february that whole corridor is contaminated.	0
  _jaycee contaminated. but with what?  a cold?  a flu?  some new thing that 99.5 percent of humans can and do fight off with white blood cells alone, not even needing otc meds.   get real.   let's get back to work and life.	0
  _jaycee that whole i-10 corridor is contaminated with covid-19. i didn't just pick that out of the air to say it there's a map showing where all the cases are.. i don't care if people go back to work i just don't want the people where i live to get sick because ppl come here.	0
  _jaycee contaminated with what?again, what is covid-19?i'm sure you had to dig deep to think of what to say while trying to be a smart-ass. i don't know whether you realize this or not i didn't ask for any comments,i made a statement and nothing of it concerns you.	0
  _jaycee that whole i-10 corridor is contaminated with covid-19. i didn't just pick that out of the air to say it there's a map showing where all the cases are.. i don't care if people go back to work i just don't want the people where i live to get sick because ppl come here.	0
  _jaycee just wanting you stop being scared.  we know it's nothing to be afraid of unless you choose to be.  recent antibody tests show that it has a very low fatality rate and has likely been here since late 2019. you may choose fear if you wish. 	0
  _jaycee i'm  not afraid for myself. it's  the ppl in my community  i want kept safe. when vacationers come here and they've got 20 in a room and the restaurants same then a service station movies.  who you think's going to get sick the people that live here. i care for my community.	0

q. how long does the virus survive on surfaces?a. studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the covid-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days... (a thread👇)	0
this may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).	0
if you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. wash your hands with soap and water or clean them hands with an alcohol-based hand rub. avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.	0

this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.	0
you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.why?	0
when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.why?	0
hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.	0
this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately.why?	0
droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and covid-19. stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.	0
follow the directions of your local health authority.why? national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.	0

 just a quick question mark, when does it end? not with a vaccine because most people won't get the vaccine. i am one who understands that like most viruses it is herd immunity that is truly the end game. what is your opinion?	0
i'm kinda glad they are making this decision. let the market decide that this is a terrible idea. 	0
 quick answer. i'm going to wear a mask in public and will avoid establishments that don't require it. the point i'm making is an economics/demand point. i'm not a doctor and don't claim to be one.	0

covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climatesfrom the evidence so far, the covid-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather.	0
actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. the best way to protect yourself against covid-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.	0
by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. 	0
the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites.to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.	0
the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.	0
to protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. 	0
are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. 	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. 	0
how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.	0
however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. 	0
the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.	0
although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. 	0
can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.	0
there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. 	0
can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 	0
does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.	0
who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. 	0
are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.	0

_velgarn _mlp well, yes you should still make sure to wash your hands properly. if you use soap or regular (non alcohol and non chlorhexidine (4%)) hand sanitizer, you are running the risk of passing this crap on to those of us who are at risk.	0

studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?”letsfightcorona 	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.letsfightcorona 	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. letsfightcorona 	0
other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.letsfightcorona 	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.letsfightcorona 	0
this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.letsfightcorona 	0
who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    letsfightcorona 	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?letsfightcorona 	0
can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?letsfightcorona 	0

what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?- regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.why? washing with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.	0
maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.why? when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets.	0

 historically it has been to do serology or blood tests for pathogen-specific antibodies. this study suggests that this may not be as useful over time.  which brings up other than live virus re-exposure tests, if there is protection, what is the best test? again, time will tell.	0
 2/n we know that immune protection exists in animal and monkey testing upon re-exposure. however, many have used antibody titers as a test to check immune memory in the clinic. this may unfortunately not be as useful for covid-19.	0
 booster vaccine shots can be given if needed. however, we don’t know how those who’ve been infected already, but then have reduced antibody levels, will respond to re-exposure. the same or different?  for those who haven’t had it yet, no one wants to run that risk.	0

_ no. it’s not. it’s spread through droplets from coughing or sneezing, so typically it’s from direct contact or contact w/ those droplets, but it’s not airborne.	0

how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.	0
world health organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. 	0
  this is a red-state that consumes foxnews. foxnews has been saying covid-19 is just like the flu.do you think getting the church involved to spread the truth would help!	1

" big scepticism towards any ""facts"" the media puts forward. with so many contradicting ""facts"" flowing around, best to accept the safest version, especially if these ""facts"" are not substantiated by trustworthy sources."	0
 if 5g is faster and it spreads this virus does this mean 4g and the rest was then slowly making us sick? dont they all have to some extend emit radiation.	0
 you'll really need to give us hard evidence to prove what you are saying	0
 of course. but we will keep destroying them because they are harmful!	0
 why don't you update us about covid 19 stats that is killing folks now, we will worry about 5g later, am sure you don't have scientific evidence for the sort of harm 5g has either...	0

  you are 1/2 correct thousand already infected  which means mortality rate is provably lower than the seasonal flu.  this fear is insane and ignorant.     don’t reply just wait and see.  covid-19 is just like the flu.	1
there are at least 4 coronavirus cases in the us that are not travel-related, officials say	1
 11 new cases in san antonio texas. let’s face it, there are thousands of cases in the united states right now that we are not even aware of. this is going to get really bad really fast.	1
  you’re ignorant. i hope you don’t have any loved ones that are in the 15 to 18% mortality rate, which is anyone over the age of 80.  this is nowhere near equivalent to the flu.  it’s worse.	1

should i wear a mask? people with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not need to wear a medical mask. who (world health organization) advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks. tuskegee_rys20	0
can i catch covid-19 from my pets? tuskegee_rys20 	0
is it safe to recieve a package from where the virus has been reported? yes. the chance of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching it from a package that travelled, and exposed to diff. conditions and temps is also low tuskegee_rys20 	0
is there anything i shouldnt do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:-smoking-taking traditional herbal remedies-wearing multiple masks-taking self-medication such as antibiotics  tuskegee_rys20 	0

    what do you mean by “brought these issues to light”.are you talking about press leaks, sticking it on a forum, a tweet.rangers went through the complaints system to the letter.are you really suggesting rangers should’ve breached confidentiality?like giving vote results early.	0
    he did, he was fobbed off, time &amp; again. rangers complained about mclennan even being appointed. they also complained about doncaster when he was previously made the subject of an enquiry in youth football, where he was accused of lying.this hasn’t popped up out of the blue.	0
"    ""he did, he was fobbed off, time &amp; again""is there any actual proof to back up your claim here?"	0
    there may be in the minutes. you’ll have to ask the spfl, specifically nd &amp; rm, why the minutes weren’t signed off for months.as it is, the reaction of rangers satisfies me that they were getting fobbed off. that’s why we are where we are now.	0
    the minutes should have been signed off, and any other concerns dealt with but it's absolutely bizarre that no one, not one single person, brought these issues to light, until dundee's vote got lost in the spfl computer system.	0
    no. i'm  saying he should have brought the issues up at the time. i think rangers thought something dodgy went down when dundee's vote was lost, came out shouting, and when it was shown to be a glitch in the system, rangers have tried to justify their initial claim of corruption	0

   my source, the who says what most public health experts saycan the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air	0
are the experts telling us it's going to be worse so, when it's not as bad, we are pleasantly surprised?watch risk psychology expert  join  on last night's realtime: 	0
   sadly, this guy was supposed to be an expert on risk and he was saying rather ignorantly that folks on planes and airplanes could be safe if they didn’t touch things but the virus is mostly airborne. that’s dangerously misleading at the most important time. stay say out there!	0
    yes, this is true, but how are respiratory droplets spread? people cough them into the air and then they move. through the air. they literally spread in the air.	0
    you guys are right that i was too unequivocal and imprecise. particles do travel in the air. about 5-6 feet. then they drop. which is why all pub health officials say the main way the virus spreads is contact. unless we're close together.	0

6/. so what is the logic behind easing lockdown early?could it be the same logic that was behind the decisions not to screen at airports, not to ban public events in march, to delay lockdown etc.?the logic of herdimmunity - of “taking it on the chin”!	0
"3/. “i think it's extraordinarily risky. i don’t think anyone could believe, from the scientific point of view, that this is a wise move.”former csa, sir david king, thinks easing lockdown “too quickly"" makes the risk of a second wave ""very significant"". "	0
4/. “do you think the pm went against the will of his scientists?' “this is definitely a political decision.”_david_king.he points out that lifting lockdown too early doesn’t make sense from a scientific or an economic perspective. 	0
5/. alok sharma just told bbc that the govt has met it’s 5 tests &amp; that “we had almost 240,000 people tested on monday”yesterday,  said he didn’t have the data on how many people had been tested.the uk doesn’t have a digital test, trace, isolate system in place. 	0
7/. herdimmunity makes sense as an outcome not as a strategy...but on 12/3, briefed by no.10,  wrote: “the strategy of the govt is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so we acquire herd immunity.”has this goal really changed? 	0
8/. as well as costing hundreds of thousands of lives, herdimmunity would depend on people developing immunity to covid19, which is not certain.antibodies don’t equal immunity &amp; immunity to other human coronaviruses (e.g sars &amp; mers) is only temporary.	0
9/. the govt deny herdimmunity was ever their strategy.many think it was, until the 16 march when new data emerged.but uk lockdown was intended to prevent the nhs being overwhelmed rather than being part of a full suppression/elimination strategy. 	0
10/. the uk govt isn’t all alone.last month,  was asked if the us “just have to accept the idea that by reopening there will be more death?”“we have to be warriors. we can't keep our country closed down for years,” he replied. covid19 	0
11/. but the pm doesn’t talk of death. instead he tells us “cautious optimism is palpable.”on 3 feb, he was optimistic too, warning against “medically irrational” reactions to covid19 that could “damage the economy.”was this herdimmunity strategy? 	0
12/. now is not the time for blame.it’s a time for honesty, for transparency and for unity.there are massive decisions facing our country in the coming months.we need sober leadship, responsible journalism &amp; for govt to listen to all our top scientists.herdimmunityscandal 	0
13/. lack of transparency means little hard proof of herdimmunity plans, but a leaked document shows on 23/3 faculty – contracted with palantir to build nhsx platform - proposed a simulation to assess the impact of “targeted herd immunity” (an oxymoron).	0

"16/. ""[this document] should be in the public domain. there’s nothing in it that justifies secrecy...the fact we have to ask if we can share these things is crazy. it’s even crazier we might be told no....phe are unable to publish anything [without govt say so].""  source "	0

"19/. four months in, &amp; we still don’t know the govt’s objective.""is the objective still to let coronavirus flow through the population &amp; just to stay within nhs capacity?""  asks. if so, that would explain the deadly herdimmunity strategy!"	0
"20/. in april, the govt changed the 5th test for easing lockdown from ""ensuring any adjustments will not risk a second peak” to ""adjustments will not overwhelm the nhs.""when _hunt asked  why, he said: ""i'm not sure i can tell you""."	0
21/. that patrick vallance &amp; no minister has been able to tell us why this significant change was made, is extraordinary but unsurprising.but we don’t actually need them to explain.the answer is v clear.the govt is pursuing a herdimmunity strategy.  	0
22/. the fact the govt never diverted from the herdimmunity strategy, makes the thinking behind their often inexplicable (in)actions, fall into place.the bewildering multiplicity of scandals are all part of one single scandal: the herdimmunitscandal.	0
23/. uk isn’t alone in attempting a herdimmunity strategy.sweden was open about it &amp; has a covid19 mortality rate 7x higher than rest of eu with cases rising 16x faster.us &amp; brazil have a policy of “opening the economy”.dutch situation echoes uk.👇  	0
24/. ons figures released today show a slight increase in community transmission &amp; that the downward trend has levelled off. it shows only 1 in 1100 are estimated to be infected.ystdy, us had the highest single-day total of new infections. breaking  	0
"we shouldn’t read too much into these figures.the study found  only 14 positive cases in 25,000 tests &amp; ons says we ""don't have evidence that the current trend is anything other than flat"".i fear we are not in the ""dance phase"" but rather back on the ""mitigation"" trajectory. "	0
"26/. asked by  why uk has the highest death rate in the world, _rees_mogg suggests it could be to with the weather.""even things as simple as the weather may have influenced coronavirus has spread, &amp; so may the practices of individual cultures &amp; societies.” "	0
27/. asked how many people are be being tested per day,  said ystdy “we don’t have those data.”the govt haven’t released the figures for more than a month.yet ministers seem happy to blurt out big numbers &amp; tell us how well the uk is doing. 	0
28/. italy’s health minister says  told italy’s pm on 13/3 that “he wants herdimmunity.”on 12/ 3,  wrote: “the strategy of the govt is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity.”the govt didn’t correct him. 	0
29/ the number of suspected coronavirus outbreaks in schools almost doubled last week, new public health england figures show.there number of “acute respiratory outbreaks” in schools rose from 24 to 44 – 16 more outbreaks than were recorded at hospitals.	0

" and yet there is still no proof, as far as i'm aware, that having the virus gives you immunity for anything more than a few months. within this context any ""herd immunity"" policy is more like state sanctioned murder, no?"	0
 no, it's the simple logic that there would be catastrophic economic damage if it continued for much longer.	0

 _wood1 what is the goal of a vaccine? you guessed it. herd immunity! not everyone can take a vaccine. people used to have measle and chicken pox parties to get it over with. i’m not saying covid is the same disease but this idea you have to hide until there’s a vaccine is moronic	0
  that's just plain not true. we're not declining as a whole around the country but are holding fairly steady as some states improve but others get worse. and i notice you conveniently ignored all of the data i shared providing context to your first graph.	0
_wood1  i didn’t ignore anything. arguing on social media solves nothing. you’ll have your opinion no matter what i share.	0
_wood1  the fact of the matter is the general population of 18 to 50 that is relatively healthy is going to need to be exposed to covid. it’s called developing heard immunity. hiding in your house from the virus like it’s a cat burglar does not work. i’m not saying not to wear your mask.	0
 _wood1 this is false. the vaccine will create immunity as they have for other communicable diseases. there is no need to risk people’s lives until the vaccine because you don’t like a mask.	0
 _wood1 you’d rather knowingly let people die to achieve a goal that we will achieve in 6 months without the unnecessary deaths... wait for it... so you don’t have to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth sometimes...bless your heart. good bye	0
what is a novel coronavirus?a novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that hasn't been previously identified. the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) isn't the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans &amp; cause mild illness like the common cold.	0

can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2	0
what is a coronavirus?coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers, sars and now, covid-19.	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3	0
older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3	0
how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	0
however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

 what if droplets from an infected persons sneeze are floating in the air?the problem here is because this is a new virus, there are  many contradictory messages floating around. like, those without symptoms need not wear a mask. but, many infected persons dont have symptoms.	0

 right. that means the defense needs to be excellent for them to be correct. when the d is not excellent, i will be proven 100% correct. he is really good. the defense will not be.	0
