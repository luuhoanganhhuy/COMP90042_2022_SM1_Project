Protection measures for everyone!

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.","2. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019","3. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.

Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.

People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.,"9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread?","10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.","11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.",13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.,"13.(A)
However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:","13.(B)
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.","13. (C)
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.","13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

24,"The Coronavirus Outbreak
Answers to your most common questions:
Updated March 2, 2020

What is a coronavirus?
It is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can","and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to lung lesions and pneumonia.
How contagious is the virus?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces.","The pathogen can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.Where has the virus spread?
The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 89,700 in","at least 67 countries and more than 3,000 have died. The spread has slowed in China, but is picking up speed in Europe and the United States.
What symptoms should I look out for?
Symptoms, which can take between two to 14 days to appear, include fever, cough","and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, but people may be able to pass on the virus even before they develop symptoms.
How do I keep myself and others safe?
Washing your hands frequently is the most","the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you‚Äôre sick and avoiding touching your face.
How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?
Keep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand.","Have a support system in place for elderly family members.
What if I‚Äôm traveling?
The C.D.C. has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea, China, Italy and Iran. And the agency has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan.","How long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine?
Several drugs are being tested, and some initial findings are expected soon. A vaccine to stop the spread is still at least a year away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29,"MISCONCEPTIONS

¬†1.) COVID-19 is just like the flu/another strain of the flu.

¬†2.) COVID-19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu.

¬†3.) Younger individuals should not be worried about the virus.","Of greater concern to younger individuals, and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of COVID-19 in this coming fall. (4) The reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infect","all individuals, young and old and typically more virulent as well.(5) Which brings me to point #4.¬†
¬†4.) The actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction.","The prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in COVID-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of COVID-19 in the fall able to severely","affect all individuals as the more COVID-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) The stopping of the spread of COVID-19 now is CRUCIAL to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly,","immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. It should also be noted that not extending the course of the COVID-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace as","a result of financial need leading to increased spread. (7,8)

I would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic, and I applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases.","I am, however, passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases. I highly encourage everyone of you to do your research, educate yourself on how you can best help yourself, your family,",and your community. The efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort. The actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come.,"I urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself.¬†

33,"Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.
There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases.

Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. https://t.co/kSdfGWv5GI","Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?
No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/2pmp1tHJwG","How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?
Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.","However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn","Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?
No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.","Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan","Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.","The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.","Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP","Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.","There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6","Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties.

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).","Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.","WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K","Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU","Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).","However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.","Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

A: No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
The 2019-nC0V is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should  not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

A: People of all ages can be infected by the virus. Older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill. https://t.co/lyFyUnBXUb","Q: Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

A: To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the virus.

A: Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting #2019nCoV.

101,"Myths about the Corona Virus

1. Taking ice cream and other cold foods do not facilitate or aid the onset of the disease.
2. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease.
3. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted via mosquito bites. https://t.co/RBZy4aA12F","4. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.","5. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.","5. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.",This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.,"6. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces,","but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.
7. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","8. To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECOVERY trial loading regime designed to reach the IC50 for SARS-CoV-2 from in vitro studies rapidly, but chronic HCQ treatment for, say, rheumatoid reaches these concentrations but much more slowly.","@88549439 Admittedly, the [HCQ] reached is at upper end of what used for RhA, but within that range.","@88549439 Paper not out but last weekend owing to the WHO recommended pause, a safety analysis was reported to show no toxicity signal.

You can protect yourself by:
-  Washing your hands with soap and running water frequently : before and after eating, after using toilet, touching animals or animal waste
- Covering mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing","- Avoiding close contact with anyone who shows symptoms.
- Seek medical care if you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

UV lamps shouldn‚Äôt be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause cell deaths. 

How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?","Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever because of infection with the virus.

They can‚Äôt detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. Due to it taking between 2-10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.","Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).","Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the virus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the virus.

The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.","Can rinsing your nose with saline help prevent the virus?

No. There is no evidence that rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from the virus. 

There is some limited evidence that rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold.","People of all ages can be infected by covid-19. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. 

Are antibiotics effective in treating the virus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.","All sources are from the world health organisation website. Everything i‚Äôve posted has been approved and factually checked.

ü§ß People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

üí¶ The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.","ü•Ñ These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.

‚ÜîÔ∏è People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who","coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.","Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.","However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 5

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

#FREDIBOAT","Part 6

How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

#FREDIBOAT","Part 7

These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19","Part 8

who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.¬†¬†¬†¬†

#FREDIBOAT","Part 9
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.¬† See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread?‚Äù","Part 10

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 11

many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.¬† 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 12

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.¬†¬†¬†¬†
#FREDIBOAT","Part 13

Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 14 

route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 15

Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT","for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as","Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT","Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

**********

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 26

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 28
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

#FREDIBOAT","Part 29

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around","Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to","Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT","Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. https://t.co/LM6wHFpLd9",Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.

People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.","These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.

People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with ++",COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?","The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.","This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.","You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.","Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why?","When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why?","Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.","This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why?","Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.","Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.","This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have++","diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

260,"How does Covid-19 spread?
At the moment, we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets. Droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing.","As of today,¬†169,906¬†Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in¬†6,644¬†fatalities worldwide. After its discovery last December, in Wuhan, China, the virus started to spread around the world, causing panic.","How do the seven human
coronaviruses differ?

The main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. The first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while Sars and Mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity.","How do viruses work?
A virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. It enters the cell through binding with receptors and ‚Äúreprogrammes it‚Äù to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body.","The virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. Washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection.","There are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. But this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty.","How deadly is the new coronavirus compared to Sars, Mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold?
We cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed.","Also, with Covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.

The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since Covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal.","It is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. Compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for Sars-Cov-2 is higher.","Although compared to Sars (9.6 per cent) and Mers (34.4 per cent), Covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger.","Can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus?
For some respiratory viruses this does happen. Not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. In this case, it is still premature to say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods or packages countries with ongoing transmission.","Till date, there is no known case of COVID-19 in Nigeria associated with imported goods.","Should I stop my children from going to school?

No. The current situation in the country does not warrant a shutdown of daily activities. During a pandemic, various measures are instituted depending on how serious the illness is and how easily it is spread from person to person.","At the moment, there is one confirmed case in Nigeria. Therefore, measures such as school closure or closure of large gatherings, are not required. Persons with persistent cough or sneezing should stay home or keep a social distance, but not mix in a crowd.","Is there anything a person can do to avoid becoming infected?

To reduce the risk of infection or spread of COVID-19, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following hand and respiratory hygiene measures:",‚Ä¢ Wash your hands regularly with soap under running water and use hand sanitisers frequently,"‚Ä¢ Cover your mouth and nose properly with tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing and immediately dispose of the tissue in a covered waste bin. After this, wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser",‚Ä¢ You may also cough into your elbow if disposable tissue is not available. You are strongly advised not to re-use handkerchiefs,"‚Ä¢ If you become sick while travelling, you should avoid close contact with other people while you are symptomatic and cover your mouth and nose with a face mask",‚Ä¢ Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing,‚Ä¢ Healthcare workers are always advised to observe standard infection prevention and control measures when attending to patients and take a travel history,"What can businesses do to protect their staff?

Businesses have an important role to play in protecting their employees. Employers are advised to circulate NCDC‚Äôs public health advisory on COVID-19 to all staff.","Encourage sick employees to stay at home if they are unwell. Ensure routine cleaning of high contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones.","If staff have travelled to any of the countries with ongoing transmission, they should be advised to self-isolate for 14 days.

COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.

COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose. https://t.co/nWVjBu3ijA","#3 
Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. https://t.co/Cyv0SmvI3Z","#5 
You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. https://t.co/JkJ1p3SlHO","Thank you for reading!

326,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 

1/3","Let¬¥s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let¬¥s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here¬¥s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization.
#CovidfreeApril
#CovidfreePhilippines
#CovidfreeWorld","What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.","What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.","Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3","Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3","How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3","These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3","People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3","Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2","However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

330,"THREAD on #COVID19 spread &amp; testing.

How does COVID-19 spread?

It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. Close contact, which is being closer than 6 feet for more than 10 minutes w/a sick individual, increases your risk of catching it. (1/12) 

#COVID19US https://t.co/phLi8f97Dw","‚Ä¶ individuals with severe illness from COVID-19 may need hospital care, which would still be supportive care of symptoms because there is no specific treatment for the disease‚Ä¶ (5/12)

#COVID19US","‚Ä¶ Whether you are positive or negative, we ask that people stay home for 72 hours after their symptoms end to avoid passing illness to others‚Ä¶ (6/12)

#COVID19US","‚Ä¶ If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to stay home for 7 days after your positive test OR for 72 hours after your symptoms end, whichever is LONGER‚Ä¶ (7/12)

#COVID19US","‚Ä¶ This is different from flu, which has a specific antiviral medication that can be given if a flu test is positive. No specific treatment for COVID-19 = no different care after a positive test result. (8/12)

#COVID19US","Who gets tested? How?

Anyone with symptoms can go to a healthcare provider. If the provider decides a test is needed, they can collect specimens and request a test from the state lab or order one from a commercial lab‚Ä¶ (9/12)

#COVID19US","‚Ä¶ Working with a provider is very important‚Äîa cough and fever can have many causes, so seeing a provider will help you get an answer about cause and treatment‚Ä¶ (10/12)

#COVID19US","‚Ä¶ There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, so if your symptoms are from some other cause, it‚Äôs important that you‚Äôre working with a provider who can help you get well. (11/12)

#COVID19US","Still have questions? Follow @maricopahealth or visit https://t.co/7YJkG9Xt6m (12/12)

üì∑: @CDCgov","My kid is/I am coughing. Should I ask for testing?

Contact a healthcare provider if you or your child has symptoms such as cough, fever, or shortness of breath. Children typically have milder symptoms, more like a common cold‚Ä¶ (2/12)

#COVID19US","‚Ä¶ Treatment will not change based on a positive COVID-19 test. Positive or negative, treatment will be fluids, fever-reducing medication, rest, or other supportive care for symptoms‚Ä¶ (3/12)

#COVID19US","‚Ä¶ there is currently no treatment specific to COVID-19, so a positive test result only indicates the cause of illness, not any type of treatment‚Ä¶ (4/12)

With proper prevention this won't result in a pandemic.","@sphacelate Yes, I know that. But it takes approximately 5 weeks from the date of manifestation of the illness (not the incubation period) to die. Most people have not recovered yet. So the death rate might be a lot higher. The fact that SARS didn't spread easily means it was less dangerous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

415,"MYTH-12: DOES THE NEW CORONAVIRUS AFFECT OLDER PEOPLE, OR ARE YOUNGER PEOPLE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

14/n","MYTH-07: HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THERMAL SCANNERS IN DETECTING PEOPLE INFECTED WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. 
10/n","MYTH-08: CAN SPRAYING ALCOHOL OR CHLORINE ALL OVER YOUR BODY KILL THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes. 

11/n","MYTH-09: DO VACCINES AGAINST PNEUMONIA PROTECT YOU AGAINST THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

12/n","MYTH-10: CAN REGULARLY RINSING YOUR NOSE WITH SALINE HELP PREVENT INFECTION WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. 

13/n","MYTH-13: ARE ANTIBIOTICS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING AND TREATING THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

15/n","MYTH-14: ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC MEDICINES TO PREVENT OR TREAT THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

465,"What is #herdimmunity threshold for #COVID19?
A topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp; huge consequences for long term impact. 

New paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially (spoiler: we still don't know value). Thread.
https://t.co/Sgrg1yrlOq","Human populations are NOT WELL-MIXED &amp; HOMOGENOUS, so calcs give likely upper bound. 
Q: So what is herd immunity threshold (HIT) for real pops?
A: *Usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.","Background: If we know reproductive number R0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (HIT) for WELL-MIXED HOMOGENOUS population is simply 1-1/R0. 
(Note R0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space).","1) If some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering HIT. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).
2) If some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces HIT. 
3)If some people don't transmit that also reduces HIT.",Positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. Sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.,"However, see paper by @mgmgomes1 that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than Science paper cited above. Fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects HIT, f, for R0=3; so HIT=0.66, f = 0.94.
https://t.co/P5n0c1tXK1 https://t.co/j44vxDQ9Bq",Science paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces HIT. It considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.,The strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. The citation they give is NOT a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ Matlab files. It's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there. @sbfnk can probably provide best ones,"The take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. NOT well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential ""activity"" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce HIT for R0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43. https://t.co/z5XPjIET2e","The conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value. https://t.co/yYGDmGEdL5","What I find puzzling is that this paper is in Science. It's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. It isn't as general as @mgmgomes1 paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. Many older papers say same thing.","@mgmgomes1 paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on HIT, f based on data (colored lines in figure). https://t.co/OuxCx8yw5Q","In idealized population, early vaccination to HIT will prevent outbreak b/c Rt=R0*S/N so Rt&lt;1. However, an epidemic will overshoot HIT &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*R0)). 
For R0=2.5 (reasonable for COVID19 in some pops), HIT=0.6, and f = 0.89.","These simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led @mlipsitch to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70% of pop would get infected without interventions. Most articles cited the 70% 
*BUT* @mlipsitch knew that...
https://t.co/8dFlzOz4t9","I'd like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. But ...","Serological data from NYC suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or R0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20% - I added horiz dashed line).
https://t.co/Mwn4USQ6nk https://t.co/78ozBGuYPo","Together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;1-1/R0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1-exp(-(f*R0)), but by how much is still unknown. Ugh. 
@mlipsitch smartly gave a wide range 40-70% (20-60% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions.
https://t.co/S5criybrMz","Unfortunately, uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for HIT for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does R0). The take home message is want to get to HIT by vaccination NOT infection.","@DiseaseEcology Are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from HIV or STIs with highly stratified risk groups)?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.","The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.","Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP","Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.","There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6","Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV","Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).","Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.","WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K","Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU","Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).","However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.","Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

498,@ColinAitchison When can we expect the full results from this survey so we can interpret comprehensive results with proper context? Or do we just wait for you to selectively release sections to support the most convenient narrative of the day?,"Lot's of folks claiming school choice only benefits the wealthy, but our survey of Albertans would disagree. 

Students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended every choice of education. The percentages were pretty consistent as well.

Education choice benefits all. #abed https://t.co/ozppEImPJ8",@ColinAitchison This is rhetorical of course because the survey was so inadequately prepared and questions so leading that it was a rigged method to gather the biased responses you wanted.,"@karliwithakay @ColinAitchison There is a wealth of research evidence that shows, for example, the devastating effects of summer learning loss on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Having publicly-funded charter schools able to innovate and respond to these issues is making things better for kids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT","Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to","be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.¬†

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f","Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN","Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat","symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

555,"First, what is a coronavirus? 
Ulmer: This particular strain started in Wuhan Province. It traveled from animals to humans.
She said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first.","Panelists:
Beaumont Public Health Director Sherry Ulmer
Beaumont Emergency Management Coordinator Tim Ocnashek
BISD Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Anita Frank
From Beaumont Psychiatric Clinic, Jason Mensah",Ulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in Beaumont or Jefferson County.,"She said she doesn't want to downplay the flu. With both viruses, the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised.

""We're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu.""
""If we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us.""","She notes because COVID-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine.","Ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in Texas, but Mensah says there are 51.

Ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold.","I'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. I know (thanks to #TheDaily I think) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia.

So, mild is relative here.",Ulmer said she's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine.,"She says that's why it's important to continue ""tried and true"" healthcare methods. Wash your hands, stay home when you're sick.","Clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays.

Lysol, Clorox and 409 are CDC-approved to kill the virus.

""We understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours.""","Feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread. He gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. He's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days.","Ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. The virus is transmitted person-to-person. She says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets.",That's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing.,"Ulmer said the health department is putting together ""soemthing"" so people know what the next step is if Jefferson County has a confirmed case.","(I'm going to use Tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.)
So ... Tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures. That includes limiting crowds, increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1/2","measures. 

I would like to add, as of Friday, the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds. The comment was at this time, danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken. 2/2","Tim says ""we're not trying to scare people. There's a lot of bad information out there.""

He encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on Facebook or from friends and spreading it like it's a fact.","""We would encourage people to be patient because it's a fluid situation."" - Feldshau

He notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. However when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming.","Ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. And several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them.","""We are as prepared as we can be with the information we're getting. Of course it's fluid, but we're accustomed to these types of situations.""","Reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.
She said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are ""doing very well.""

""For our children it sounds like God has smiled on us.""","Now talking about ""flattening the curve."" People are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.

""This is not here today and gone tomorrow."" -Feldschau","Ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would ""tax our healthcare system."" Should the city/county get there, it would have to look at ""alternative"" ways to treat people. She didn't expand on what those alternatives are.",She said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.,"""I we know that you're coming, the staff can be ready for you. They can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2","as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus."" 2/2","Feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.

""If we ever lose control, we're going to have a serious problem.""","From comment section on the video: 
""If this virus is just like the flu &amp; spreads like viruses do (airborne) I‚Äôm not understanding the panic &amp; closure of so many things? What is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don‚Äôt do it for flu?""","This seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments. Someone simply responded ""yassss"" and another said people don't know what to do ""so they just shut everything down I guess.""",So even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

618,"Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.","The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/HN7yBWhYlQ","Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.","There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/X63kY0i8o3","Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX","Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?
No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%","ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.
However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT","Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to","be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.¬†

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f","Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN","Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat","symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

Hand dryers do not kill coronavirus. The best way to protect yourself and others from the virus is to wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.","2. Only older adults and young people are at risk

COVID-19, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, older adults or individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill.","3. Everyone with COVID-19 dies

COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people.

In a recent report, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that 80.9% of COVID-19 cases were mild.

What is herd immunity in Ontario for COVID? Based on @imgrund calculations, about 2.1%  with only 1 in 11 cases of COVID detected.
https://t.co/NQ4Dc29whj

Only 2.1% of population has had exposure = NO HERD IMMUNITY AND MUST BE CAREFUL!!","Perhaps you think these calculations are theoretical and don't matter. But they align very well with what Swiss researchers have found-- 11.6 cases for every 1 case detected. Most of the population of Geneva remains unexposed despite large case number.

https://t.co/SbJk1GNq7e https://t.co/iCeM0lE5hV","PLEASE--Wash your hands, wear masks, keep as far away from others and limit interactions. All these actions will help to keep you, your family, your neighbours, and our healthcare system healthy!!","So children are usually considered 'vectors of disease' and everyone believes that kids spread germs. But is this true for COVID? Could it be that kids are not the superspreaders we think they are?

https://t.co/1m3OzhZwEO","....and a link to the report they have published here üëá

https://t.co/gLl6Aw9i4T","What's going on with younger kids? Are they breathing less volume on people (yes, they are smaller)? Talk less forcefully? Do they have less prolonged interaction with others compared to older kids?

The government claims to have based their decision on sound scientific advice provided by the OMT. The Dutch centre for disease control (RIVM)..","Technical Briefing March 18th 
An important key in resolving these questions was provided in the parliamentary technical briefing of March 18th 2020. In this briefing OMT chairman ...

https://t.co/Pf4mgSVqws","Jaap van Dissel presented the following (figure 1) that outlined the strategic options that were considered by the OMT.

Figure 1, the 3 conceived COVID-19 pandemic control strategies https://t.co/NJ2MxWCHOG","The three considered strategic options:

1. No interventions, a worst-case scenario, where the virus is allowed to spread freely (red);
2. Maximum control, a mitigation scenario, where social distancing decelerates the spread (green);
3. Lock-down, a containment scenario, where..","mandatory isolation diminishes the spread (blue);

The lock-down scenario is kind of odd, it would have been expected that the post-maximum slope of this curve would be ...","significantly steeper as compared to ‚Äòno interventions‚Äô curve. Surprisingly, here the slope is even shallower than the ‚Äòmaximum control‚Äô slope. This suggests there is a feedback present, which decelerates the spread, in the model used to evaluate these strategic options. https://t.co/l2nlT9xuxM","Simplified Epidemic Modelling
Epidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease, a one-way transfer is considered, where persons transfer from one bin to the next. The rate at which persons transfer is described by ...","a parameter. An example is the SEIR model this model considers four disease stages:

1. Susceptible: persons that are susceptible to the pathogen, i.e., not immune;
2. Exposed: persons that are exposed to the pathogen, but or not yet contagious;","3. Infected: persons that can spread the pathogen;
4. Recovered: persons that have recovered, i.e., immune;

Figure 2, SEIR model containing four disease stages. https://t.co/g6Ye0pl41K","The transfer rates govern how long a person remains in a specific disease stage, e.g., the duration of the infectious period is determined by parameters %delta and %gamma. Such a disease model does not directly consider adverse effects a disease may have, ...","e.g., disability to death. 

The previously noted feedback present in the model results presented at the technical briefing, suggests there is a parallel route (figure 3) within the model used for...

Such a parallel route, if it runs via asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, could provide for a path to recovered and therefore immune persons. The other route is comprised of symptomatic persons, which may require additional care. If the ...","symptomatic persons are in their ‚Äòinfectious bin‚Äô for a longer duration, as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly, i.e., a huge dampening effect. As the pathway through ...","asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic dominates over symptomatic persons.

This parallel SEIR model, when applied to the COVID-19 data available from Wuhan (narrow spike), would yield the following conclusions about the virus:","1. was highly infectious (most infected people where not on the radar in Wuhan);
2. could not easily be contained.

Figure 4, Idealised SEIR-TTI model. https://t.co/0MoeRB2nBO","Unfortunately, the parallel SEIR model is in a sense equivalent to a SEIR model that allows for track-trace-isolation (TTI) shown in figure 4. Ironically, that is what the Chinese actually did, they aggressively tracked, traced, and isolated infected and suspected persons. ...","This essentially halts transmission, the ‚Äòexposed bin‚Äô is kept (nearly) empty.

When the SEIR-TTI model is applied to the Wuhan data this would yield the following conclusions about the virus:

1. was moderately infectious;
2. TTI was very effective.","The suspected actual used model is more involved, as it is comprised of several age levels, e.g., for each age cohort a more detailed SEIR-TTI equation is applied. When age separation is considered it may have appeared, based on Wuhan data that herd immunity could be build ...","relatively cheaply and quickly by keeping younger people at work (as the R0 would be hugely overestimated, while the severity of the disease was hugely underestimated), while vulnerable people kept home.

820,"What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.","What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 

1/3","Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3","Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3","How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3","These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3","People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3","Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2","However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

Q1: What is COVID-19?
A1: It is the acronym for coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-COV-2.

Q2: What is SARS-COV-2?
A2: It is the acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a virus.",It has been an honour working with  Prof Bhaswati Patnaik (Psy) and Prof Navaneeta Rath (Soc) on this FAQ wrt Serological Antibody Test in @bmcbbsr for #COVID19 @HealthCheck_in @IndiaSpend @WHO @ICMRDELHI @utkaluniv01 @NCDS_BBSR @HFWOdisha @IPR_Odisha https://t.co/DFZ08n9FiP,"Q3: What is serological antibody test in the context of COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2?
A3: Blood is taken from the veins and the serum/plasma put to a test to know whether the person has developed antibodies against the virus, SARS-COV-2, for the disease, COVID-19.","Q4: How long it takes to give the result of the serological antibody test?
A4: It takes 15-30 minutes to get the result of the test. So, it is a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).","Q5: Who would have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19?
 A5: Only people who were infected by SARS-COV-2 and had the disease COVID-19 are likely to have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19.","Q6: Why is the test conducted on population who are not known to have COVID-19?
A6: Some people might have been infected but were either asymptomatic or were with symptoms but have not been tested. Hence, the test is conducted on population who are not known to have it.","Q7:  Why the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar, not in other cities of Odisha?
A7: As Bhubaneswar has been declared as a hotspot and there is likelihood for the rapid spread in the city and from the city to other cities, the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar.","Q8: What is the purpose of the test?
A8:  The purpose of the test is to help in disease surveillance. It will help us arrive at an estimate of how many people from different categories of population in Bhubaneswar that might have been affected.","Q9:  Apart from random sampling for testing the population, who else can go for the antibody test?
A9: Samples of people with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza like Illness (ILI) are also being collected apart from random sampling of asymptomatic people.","Q10: Who will identify the population and design the sample to be tested?
A10: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) through experts from the health department have developed protocols for identifying population from among whom the sample is to be drawn for testing.","Q11: What will happen if the antibody test comes positive?
A11: If the antibody test comes positive, the person‚Äôs swab samples may be sent for RT-PCR test. This is another confirmatory test to know whether the person is currently suffering from COVID-19.","Q.12: Will serological antibody test help identify a person suffering from COVID-19?
A12: No, as per current practise and guidelines from @WHO &amp; @ICMRDELHI, COVID-19 +ve cases are to be identified through RT-PCR in designated laboratories/testing centres.","Q13: Will identifying people who have developed antibodies be helpful in treatment for those who are suffering from COVID-19?
A13:  An independent research protocol has to be developed where plasma from those who developed antibodies can be used to treat patients.","Q14: Will those identified with antibodies for COVID-19 be immune from the disease?
A14: Further research with people who have already developed antibodies will be required.","Q.15: Whom should the residents of the city contact for the test?
A15: The residents of the city may contact their respective RWA (Resident Welfare Association), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) or ward officer for the test.","Q16: Where from these rapid kits have come to the state?
A16: These rapid kits have been procured by @ICMRDELHI and have been supplied to Odisha.","Q17: How many rapid kits have been provided to Government of Odisha in the first phase?
A17: @ICMRDELHI has provided 6000 rapid kits for the test to Odisha in the first phase.

828,"1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?

Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.","The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.

Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ","2. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth).","3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.","4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.","5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.","6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.","7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.","8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.","WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.","9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.

However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.

Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself",9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth.

Herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely.",Will you keep wearing masks and limiting your trips out until there is a vaccine widely available?,"@Bill_Maxwell_ Yep.

What about those who can‚Äôt get vaccinated?  What about those who choose not to?

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 6

How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

#FREDIBOAT","Part 11

many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.¬†

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.¬†¬†¬†¬†
#FREDIBOAT","Part 13

Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 14 

route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT","for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as","Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT","Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around","Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to","Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in

A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia","Q. What is a CoronaVirus?
A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. 
#coronavirus #coronavirusindia","Q. What is COVID-19?
A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.","Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus","Q. How fatal is COVID-19?
A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.","[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia","Q. How does COVID-19 spreads?
A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates","[2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #CoronaAlert #coronavirus",[3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia,"Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages.","[2/2] It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #Corona #coronavirusindia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1084,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","Let¬¥s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let¬¥s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here¬¥s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization.
#CovidfreeApril
#CovidfreePhilippines
#CovidfreeWorld","Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3","Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3","How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3","These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3","People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3","Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2","However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

1090,"9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?

Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.","2. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth).","3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.","4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.","5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.","6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.","7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.","8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.","WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.","10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.

However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1106,"What is a coronavirus? 
Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS.
The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19.","I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.

It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A.","What is COVID-19? 

COVID-19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.

This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.","The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.

Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms.","Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. 

People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.","How does COVID-19 spread? 

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.","How likely am I to catch COVID-19? 

The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.","Should I worry about COVID-19? 

Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. 

It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.","Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.","Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized.","Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.","Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.","Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.","Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.","In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT","for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as","Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT","Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

**********

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 26

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 28
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

#FREDIBOAT","Part 29

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around","Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to","Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT","Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

You can see these at¬†https://t.co/IsbnwJ3QWg","Part 28

and other viruses.

If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition.

A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.","Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus","Q. How fatal is COVID-19?
A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.

1178,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.","Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.

No.

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.","Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.","Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.","In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

That's 229,767,666 people in the U.S. alone. https://t.co/fwVs57MhDq",Scientists reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious COVID-19 is specifically. This is called R0 value. It measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect. This is how COVID-19's R0 values compare to other diseases. https://t.co/BzRjrVVXvb,"Even though the numbers are high and it may seem simple at first glance, most scientists aren't onboard with relying on #HerdImmunity. Why? This tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the U.S. and 30 million around the world. That's millions too many. https://t.co/nvzOWYbOuk","Until a vaccine can provide widespread immunity, communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable, especially heading into the fall, when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain. The alternative would be devastating.","Experts also noted that by social distancing, we can mimic this tactic.

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.","Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.","In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT","for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as","Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT","Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around","Part 30

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. #FightCOVID19","There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so World Health Organization urges people to use masks wisely.

The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of... #COVID19 #FightCOVID19","...elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.

The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless","of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

#COVID19 
9/x","A ubiquitous assumption made is, that at the start, all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as SAR-CoV-2. But is this assumption always correct?
#COVID19
7/x","As a pandemic evolves, the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered. It is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease.
#COVID19
8/x","Most serologic assays have ranged from 1-3% all the way up to 20-30% in areas such as New York City. And the curve seems to be ending in NYC.  What gives?
#COVID19
10/x","Similarly, in a recent study of an isolated Alpine community in Austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected.
#COVID19
11/x

15/x","How could this be? Is it possible not all are likely to be infected? I suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical. I will share two possibilities others have explored.
#COVID19

#COVID19

Maybe polymorphisms in receptors, immunity, or other ways. We might never know. But we do know evolutionary pathways select
#COVID19 
19/x","Another possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. One such study has shown that as a possibility. They found T cell reactivity from viable T cells stored before SARS-CoV-2. In nearly one-half of cases!
#COVID19 
20/x
https://t.co/F9PSvm0yPk","This study was small but very provocative. If confirmed, this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the ""S"" (as in susceptible). In other words, you can be functionally ""immune"" even if not exposed
#COVID19

#COVID19
23/x https://t.co/uEjyNC7O3w","Modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets (proteome) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies.
#COVID19 
24/x","It is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity. That would explain why there are clusters among families or friends.  And also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers.

1439,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.",and have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong south China.,"It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States.
In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging",from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.,"What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019",Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.,"Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

1440,"Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
#OpenParlyZW","The best way to protect yourself against #COVID19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. #OpenParlyZW","Hand dryers are not effective in killing #COVID19 . To protect yourself against the new #coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. #OpenParlyZW","Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new #coronavirus ?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.
#OpenParlyZW",Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new #coronavirus. #OpenParlyZW,"However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever #OpenParlyZW","Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). #OpenParlyZW","Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations #OpenParlyZW","Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new #coronavirus #OpenParlyZW","Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

üöΩ *Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?*

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.","While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.","Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. 

üêæ *Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?*
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.","Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.","To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times.","Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.","üê∂ *Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?*
There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks.

1514,"6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.","The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.

Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ","1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?

Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.","4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.","5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.","7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.","8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.","WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.","9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

ü§ß People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.","Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

What is the approach to exposed pregnant individuals?

1. Serology testing +/- blood PCR
2. Acute infection: no congenital anomalies, but risk of fetal loss; Rx with intrauterine blood transfusion 
3. Periodic ultrasound to check for hydrops (edema, ascites, cardiomegaly)","5/
What are effects of #parvovirus B19 in pregnancy?
1. Fetal loss 6.3%
2. Hydrops fetalis 3.9%
3. Fetal pericardial / pleural effusion
4. Thrombocytopenia 

Most common up to 20 weeks AOG

Congenital anomaly is NOT an effect! (Suggested answer time MCQ)

https://t.co/vM6JOUE13a","6/
Hydrops fetalis in #parvovirus B19

Week 12-20 AOG highest risk period

Parvov infection ‚Äî&gt; severe anemia in fetus ‚Äî&gt; high-output heart failure ‚Äî&gt; abnormal accumulation of fluid in fetal tissues and cavities (ascites / effusions) ‚Äî&gt; Hydrops

https://t.co/qgKb51qTNf","7/
How do you diagnose #parvovirus B19 in fetus?

Amniotic fluid PVB19 PCR (preferred)
Fetal blood IgM testing 

Note: risky to obtain fetal blood! 

Ultrasound serially to monitor for fetal changes

https://t.co/vM6JOUE13a","8/
What is the Rx of anemia due to #parvovirus B19 in fetus?

Mild/moderate anemia - resolve spontaneously 

Severe - may lead to hydrops and death
Rx: intrauterine RBC transfusion to prevent fetal death from anemia

IVIG not recommended in pregnancy

A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.","What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).","Can humans become infected with a novel coronavirus of animal source?
Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012.","Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.","What are the symptoms of someone infected with a coronavirus?

Some estimates suggest that 50% or more of the population may not be susceptible at all to Covid.  Herd immunity may therefore kick in much sooner in the US.,"@anilvohra69 Agreed we are probably some ways off.  But then again, no one knows how much cross-immunity different populations may have.

- Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.","Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets.","- Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
- Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.","What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to",more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19,These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.,"Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.","People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.","How does COVID-19 spread?
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.

Yes. The chance of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching it from a package that travelled, and exposed to diff. conditions and temps is also low #Tuskegee_RYS20 https://t.co/KVIxII2MDd","Is there anything I SHOULDNT DO?

1852,"Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2","What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.","Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3","Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3","How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3","These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3","People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3","Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

It can enter your body through nose, eyes, mouth hence social distancing and regular hand wash is very important.","@karunanundy What if droplets from an infected persons sneeze are floating in the air?

The problem here is because this is a new virus, there are  many contradictory messages floating around. Like, those without symptoms need not wear a mask.
