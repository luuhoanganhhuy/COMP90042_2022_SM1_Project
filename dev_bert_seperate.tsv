how does covid-19 spread? people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.	0
i've read a lot about corona virus lately and i think i should share some highlights of the good read.it's a thread, and in form of q &amp; a.	0
what is a coronavirus? coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to mers &amp; sars.the most recently discovered coronavirus is covid-19.	0
should i worry about covid-19? although illness due to covid-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. it is still quite normal for people to worry about how the covid-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.	0
is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019.however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.	0
is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.	0
should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19.the mask can only be used once.if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.	0
can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.	0
is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:1. smoking2. taking traditional herbal remedies 3. wearing multiple masks 4. taking self-medication such as antibiotics.	0
in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreakthread	0
"every news outlet using headlines like,""are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?""instead of,""president's incorrect claim that antibiotics used to treat viruses, another dangerous example of medical ignorance and incompetence""can get fucked"	0

according to who:drinking methanol, ethanol or bleach does not prevent or cure covid-19 and can be extremely dangerousmethanol, ethanol, and bleach are poisons. drinking them can lead to disability and death.	0
methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces – however you should never drink them. they will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs.	0
to protect yourself against covid-19, disinfect objects and surfaces, especially the ones you touch regularly. you can use diluted bleach or alcohol for that. make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.	0

 how is that not essential ?!?!	1
   thank your friends and you know you don't really care	1
 so if amber alerts get shutdown during govt shutdown &amp; ocare gets implemented, would ocare shutdown in next gov shutdown?	1
 that will qualify as a new low, but also a wake up call of why govmtn should be restrained.	1

"remember: seasonal flu is *very different* to pandemic flu.if someone says ""covid-19 is just like the flu"", check which one they're talking about.if they mean ""seasonal flu"", take what they say with a bucketload of salt."	1
1918 spanish flu: one of the worst pandemics in history, killed up to 50 million people1957 asian flu: killed at least a million1968 hong kong flu: killed at least a million1977 russian flu: less than a million deaths2009 swine flu: killed several hundred thousand	1
one of those five pandemics, the russian flu, appears to have been just an old defrosted flu strain from a laboratory. people alive in the 1950s were immune, and the virus was weirdly similar to earlier ones. so really we're down to four truly novel pandemics.	1
anyone reading this has almost certainly lived through a pandemic, the h1n1 swine flu in 2009, but we were lucky there that it was extremely mild with a fatality rate not much different to seasonal flu.	1
fatality rates often fall as an epidemic spreads but it would be unwise to assume that case fatality in every pandemic will fall to swine flu levels. all the evidence so far suggests covid-19 mortality is higher, by at least an order of magnitude. 	1
so don't panic but please don't be complacent.lots of tech/finance types are still talking about this as if it's no big deal.virologists and epidemiologists are taking it far more seriously. 	1
 hoy did all those pandemic go away?	1
 herd immunity gradually built up to the point it wasn't able to spread easily, and under this selective pressure the virus evolved to different and less fatal strains	1
as the name implies, seasonal flu goes round the world every year. we have high rates of immunity to it because many of us have been exposed before, and we even have vaccines to prevent it.pandemic flu happens just a few times in every century and is much more alarming.	1

people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.letsfightcorona 	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. letsfightcorona 	0
other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.letsfightcorona 	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.letsfightcorona 	0

studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?”letsfightcorona 	0

 it is perplexing, read an article yesterday, that said pope was unaware, something to do with vatican politics. 	0

 thank god	0
 well, she's a very lucky person to have met him.	0
 of course it's a form of support! it just shouldn't have any impact on our political policies.  he supported the death row inmate too	0
  she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position. its a small town so go figure kanyeshrug	0
 hope he gave her a wtf about being divorced 3 times.	0
" many people ""meet"" with a pope. apparently this was a blessing in dc. he probably never heard of her then wham! he's in a storm."	0
 all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth	0

 the face of mental illness being made famous.	0
  ((saw your status on facebook the other day))	0
  yes just like people do for imagrents.	0
 then what should it be considered? unless he performed an exorcism on that witch, it will be considered support. getreal	0
 a church desperate to look cool is a sad thing	0
 she just needs to go away	0
 kimdavis should have kept this meeting private bet that's what pope wanted shes using it to glorify/publicize herself more shameless	0
 the vatican is has given in. smh. kimdavis has more guts and stronger in her faith than the vatican and it pope.	0
 popefrancis is a bullshitter	0
 what is it then? does catholic church support homosexuality? does it conduct gay marriages?	0
 so what was it then?trying to help the sinner stop homophobing?a strategy session?swapping culture war stories?an affair?	0
 don't tell me that the vatican us telling a lie	0
 it's definitely support. but the pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse. so who really cares.	0
 then exactly how should the meeting be considered?  shouldn't have met with kimdavis to begin with. rewarded bad behavior.	0
 .  nor forgiveness...	0
 so what is it? with god there is no sitting on the wall	0
 with that meeting, the pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was.	0

 😒	0
  so i assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage?	0
 millions of catholics wait a lifetime to share a moment with a pope.why her?because the pope is a socialist who knows propaganda!	0

 popeturd is back tracking already... the pc police flexing their muscle again... disgusting; and people still worship this false idol.	0
  why would he meet with her anyway? you lost me, off my list!	0
 simply stop talking about her	0
 funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be...	0
   he met with a gay couple the day before kim davis	0
 then he shouldn't have met with her!!	0
 doesn't matter why or what was said. she will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia. just like they do with abortion issue	0
 no it should not!	0
 the vatican is hedging its bets in case she goes full psycho. (she's halfway there.)	0
 pope met w/her in support of her religious liberty &amp; conscience to put god's law above constitution, which he made clear his position.	0
 he too (pope) will stand before god. but won't be left standing. repent of thy ways &amp; turn to god &amp; his ways. kimdavis -be encouraged	0
 that is a lie and the vatican didn't say that. homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians. kimdavis	0

    great, what is the timeframe for widely available vaccines so we can reach herd immunity before 1m people die? or 2m?	0
from : four covid19 vaccines have reported neutralizing antibody titers from immunized non-human primates.  had at least an order of magnitude higher titers; but differences in the trial designs can make direct comparisons difficult.  	0
   and this is progress? makes a vaccine seem really far off!	0
    novavax will release their phase 1 trial results on 130 humans in july. they are using a well established protocol of making a pre-fusion covid spike protein through expression of recombinant insect cells and an adjuvant that enhances immune response.	0
    at risk they’re mass producing 100 m doses for december &amp; have secured resources to make a billion doses in 2021	0
    we'll be well past 1m deaths at that rate. maybe 1m just in the usa by then with all this slack government response.	0

can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.	0
however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at d early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  who is assessing ongoing research	0
how likely am i to catch the covid 19	0
the risk depends on where you  are - and more ,whether there is a covid-19 outbreak unfolding there.for most people in most locations the risk of catching covid-19 is still low. however, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading	0
covid-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in china and some other countries. unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. it’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. there is daily updates on the situation	0
many are still in the dark over this question. what is a coronavirus? 	0
see that green line at the bottom? that's the one country that a few weeks ago achieved masks4all. czech republic. watch this space - in another week the difference will be even more stark. 	0
can i catch covid-19 from my pet? 	0
how long is the incubation period for covid-19? 	0
can humans become infected with the covid-19 from an animal source? 	0
how long does the virus survive on surfaces? 	0
is it safe to receive a package from any area where covid-19 has been reported? 	0
is there anything i should not do? 	0
  “the flu is a much bigger threat than coronavirus, for now.” this was written before the us had any confirmed cases. and there is a difference between stating that the flu is a bigger threat and claiming covid-19 is just like the flu (despite having a mortality rate 30x the flu).	1
analysis: misunderstanding the math, trump embraced a coronavirus death toll we’ll soon surpass 	1
  so i take it you are glad trump took measures even before this article came out? or are you one of the people who thinks trump acted too late? if so, then wapo should have known at the time this article came out.	1
  are you referring to the incomplete ban on travel from china, which didn’t prevent the virus from coming to america, that was issued two days before this article?	1

" _tiffany   i'm not sure about ""less safe.""the option is not usps, fedex, ups, or nothing; other delivery services could emerge.also, let the usps charge more for ""dangerous delivery"" areas. again: should urban folks subsidize rural folks &amp; why?"	0

   '...the world health organization insists “the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites.”“to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes,” the who reports.'	0
 this would make grocery shopping a pretty serious issue.we've been told that social distancing is what was needed. if these studies are true, then we'd need much more isolation. for what it's worth, i certainly hope that this airborne transmission is disproven. fingers crossed.	0
 it would also make the use of masks mandatory for everyone, btw which is something the cdc has been very reluctant to propose. the question i have is why covid-19 is less transmissible than measles if it is actually an airborne transmitted disease?	0
 the size of respiratory particles for coronavirus is thought to be larger than for measles, so it was thought to spread less readily. this latest research suggests that these prior assumptions are not correct and that covid19 can spread much more easily than previous guidance.	0
"   i thought that article was pretty clear, but here's another one just in case.  i'll also clearly say ""there is no evidence that mosquitos can spread the coronavirus"", in the same light that there's no evidence my penis can shoot laser beams."	0
how does covid-19 spread? the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid19 coughs or exhales. these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. covid19publicdialogueug	0
others catch the virus by touching these objects or surfaces,  then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with the virus. that's why it's important to stay more than 1 meet away from a person with the virus.	0
can the coronavirus be transmitted through air? studies to date suggest that the virus is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through air. covidpublicdialogueug	0

  respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets yes but what is covid 19 and how does it get transmitted?this is what a real expert's answer looks like; 	0
 hi charlotte. that isn't 'defiance', that's 'denial'. breath aerosol is the main transmission route for the virus. being in close proximity to people is a major risk, for them and for you and for all of us. social distancing is pretty much the only weapon we have right now.	0
  where is the evidence for that?	0
  viruses don't care about rights.	0
  and that means we should destroy our economy and create a police state?	0

the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites.to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.	0
the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. 	0
to protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. 	0
are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. 	0
can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. 	0
how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.	0
however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. 	0
can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.	0
spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. 	0
do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.	0
the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.	0
although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. 	0
can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.	0
there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. 	0
can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 	0
does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.	0
who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	0
however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. 	0
are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.	0
some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.pls don't panic people with fake news because it's not real all facts are in these threads 	0
q. is it safe to receive a package from any area where covid-19 has been reported?a. yes. the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods &amp; the risk of catching the virus from a package that has been exposed to different conditions &amp; temperature is very low.	0
q. how long does the virus survive on surfaces?a. [1/2] preliminary studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days but this may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).	0
[2/2] if you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. coronavirusreachesdelhi	0
who is at risk of developing severe illness?older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. covidー19 covid  covid_19	0

  bell, we know you're the top health expert on the planet. you are right and all other health experts are wrong, good day!	1
  h1n1 killed 4,000 in the u.s. which is why they weren't overwhelmed. the rate of serious illness with h1n1 was no greater than the flu, unlike coronavirus.that and the massive deaths in areas with weaker health systems should be a warning of what covid-19 could do uncontrolled.	1
         do we really need new voters register?why do we need it?what's  wrong with our current biometric voters register?	0
why do we have to compiled a new voters register in midst of the world pandemic covid19?is that the reason president  lifted the lock down? why those who have to speak on behalf of voiceless are quiet?, , , ,  etc 	0
        then we must as well not conduct an election	0
        why?	0
        cos of the same reasons u giving for the new register. cos the last time i checked we will queue and vote just like conducting a new register	0
         boss i still don't get, have they cancelled the registration or they have to conduct it before voting?	0
         it has been cancelled for now. the ec is still thinking around ways to conduct it in the era of this pandemic	0
         hmm so incase this virus still around in december are we gonna vote ?	0
         excellent question that needs to be answered by the hypocrites speaking against the new register	0
         are you guys thinking the two exercise, vr &amp; election are same? no, they're not and will never be the same. the fact that the two exercise will involve people being in queue doesn't mean we can't conduct election in dec if situation remain same. our election is just a day event.	0
         does it take 100 days to be infected by somebody who has the virus? certainly no cos as far as i know it can take a day. so your point is flawed	0
         how many times do u have to be educated on the reasons. or is it that u don't read to understand?	0

"    because covid-19 is just like the flu?you are proving the point of the tweet, every time you reply like this:""obama good! orangeman bad!"""	1
   looks like steve, in his hope &amp; change, anti-trump rage, couldn't spend 5 minutes to look up the facts. that's soooo unusual for reactionary progressives. 	1
    funny how that works. h1n1 has killed ~13k people in the span of one year in the us alone.covid 19 has killed ~42k people in the span of 4 months.	1
    funny how many people on the left are justifying obama's numbers and giving him a pass... 	1
    funny. is obama currently president? did the gop during h1n1 give him a pass? (the answer to both is no btw) ~13k in a year or 40k in 4 months is a small difference, ya know? you are very funny	1
    no. covid 19 is not like the flu.and yes. obama was objectively better than the orange man. but keep licking the trump boot.	1
covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climatesfrom the evidence so far, the covid-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials	0
covid-19 myths vs truth 	0
5g doesn’t spread covid-19viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. covid-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5g mobile networks.covid-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks.	0
exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25c degrees does not prevent the coronavirus disease (covid-19)you can catch covid-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. countries with hot weather have reported cases of covid-19.	0
you can recover from the coronavirus disease (covid-19). catching covid-19 does not mean you will have it for life.most of the people who catch covid-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. if you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms.	0
being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean you are free from the covid-19 or any other lung disease.the most common symptoms of covid-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. take an official test to confirm.	0
drinking alcohol does not protect you against covid-19 and can be dangerousfrequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system- which helps fight against the virus.	0
cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus.there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the external temperature or weather.	0
taking a hot bath does not prevent the virustaking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching covid-19. your body temperature is 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you	0
the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites.to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.  the coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets.	0

"we know they're shallow. we know they are frivolous. the first description of the rich mom is that she's ""simple."" it's part of the hook, part of the reason why everything happens.so why do we need it reiterated with this played out stereotype?it just doesn't quite fit."	0
i hesitate to say there's such a thing as a perfect film, but having just watched parasite for the first time, it hits pretty damn fucking close.	0
i'm genuinely trying to think of things that bugged me. the one that struck me the most was how, yet again, we have a thriller type film like us where we have to include native americans somehow. it's beyond played out at this point &amp; i wish they'd gone with something else.	0
bong joon-ho clearly trusts his audience. having just seen train to busan last year, his development from even then to now is clear. he doesn't bother with excess. and parasite is so well trimmed.but here we have just a little fat, a chewy piece on an otherwise perfect steak.	0
and what would've made the film even closer to perfect was if some people who saw it weren't alienated by his inclusion of that trope.i remember the discourse. stuff like that hurts folk. i remember it with us too.and that's really the only thing bad about parasite.	0
"it rightfully joins the ranks of annihilation, mad max: fury road, no country for old men, pacific rim, pan's labyrinth, there will be blood, and us as ""films riley will keep thinking about for years.""it's deserving. they all are almost perfect. and i really will keep thinking."	0
 i've wanted to see that one but i hear it has ghosts.	0
 i think that's part of the intent, but also it's to show how western values have been forced into korean society. the rich family identifies with americans and blindly reproduces the harm the us has caused.should be clear, i don't think that excuses it, you're right that it's	0
 a tired and harmful depiction, but i think even if it could have been handled a lot better it was going for something deeper than just reinforcing how they're out of touch.	0
 they are obsessed with american culture and the way that comes out is the son obsessed with cowboys and indians from our westerns. they don't consider the cultural implications at all bc they're so far removed from it geographically and economically.	0
mythbusters covid19can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? no.just 👏 wash 👏 your 👏 hands 👏 with 👏 soap 	0
 infection generally starts in the nose. once inside the body, the coronavirus invades the epithelial cells that line and protect the respiratory tract.  regular rinsing might help with some symptoms of the common cold but cannot prevent or cure covid-19	0

3. how does covid-19 spread?  the virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing).	0
individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). the covid-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.	0
  do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.	0
i’m an older (57yr) rn. i lived through h1n1 &amp; avian flu. in hospital, clinic &amp; public health units we were over prepared. speaking out national nurses united has stated alarm for our nurses. i am stunned by disregard &amp; unpreparedness of this administration  for coronavirus.	0
 i’m very worried about healthcare workers amidst this chaos. i have a question for you. would a viral pneumonia vaccination minimize the risks for coronavirus turning into a secondary respiratory problem? and would it prevent elder caregivers from passing it on to residents?	0
 i believe in vaccination and you have brought up a really important complication of any flu. i think both flu &amp; pneumonia vaccine should not be overlooked. thanks for getting this out there.	0

how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. (1/3) 	0
these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. (2/3)	0
people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. (3/3)e: covid19.ac.zat: 0800 029 999ukzncovid19	0
can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?	0
what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 	0
some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.	0
the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms.	0
this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.	0
you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	0
why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.why?	0
when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.why?	0
hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.	0
this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately.why?	0
droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and covid-19. stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.	0
follow the directions of your local health authority.why? national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.	0
this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely). if possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++	0

17. you can recover from the coronavirus disease (covid-19). catching the new coronavirus does not mean you will have it for life. 	0
13. cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus. 	0
14. covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates 	0
15. drinking alcohol does not protect you against covid-19 and can be dangerous 	0
16. being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (covid-19) or any other lung disease. 	0
18. exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25c degrees does not prevent the coronavirus disease (covid-19) 	0
19. 5g mobile networks do not spread covid-19 	0
4. covid-19 is just like the flusars-cov-2 definitely has flu like symptoms- aches, fever, and cough. both covid-19 and flu can also lead to pneumonia. however, covid-19 is more dangerous with  with a mortality rate between 1% and 3%,10-50 times greater than the seasonal flu	1
2. older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risksars-cov-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. however, anyone with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.	1
5. everyone with covid-19 diesthis statement is untrue. as we have mentioned above, covid-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. in fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization	1
6. cats and dogs spread coronaviruscurrently, very little evidence. however, in hong kong, a pomeranian whose owner had covid-19 became infected. the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus	1
7. face masks protect against coronavirusdisposable face masks may not provide protection. yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. thus viral particles can also enter.	1
8. hand dryers kill coronavirushand dryers dont kill. only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself	1
9. sars-cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldall coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.	1
9-2. thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans.	1
10. antibiotics kill coronavirusantibiotics only kill bacteria and not  viruses.	1
14. thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusthermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonscovid-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.	1
15.  flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid-19as sars-cov-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.so please dont panic, follow the govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. finally dont forget to pray. shambho mahadeva🙏	1

5g doesn’t spread covid-19viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. covid-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5g mobile networks.covid-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks.	0
exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25c degrees does not prevent the coronavirus disease (covid-19)you can catch covid-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. countries with hot weather have reported cases of covid-19.	0
you can recover from the coronavirus disease (covid-19). catching covid-19 does not mean you will have it for life.most of the people who catch covid-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. if you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms.	0
being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean you are free from the covid-19 or any other lung disease.the most common symptoms of covid-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. take an official test to confirm.	0
covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climatesfrom the evidence so far, the covid-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials	0
cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus.there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the external temperature or weather.	0
taking a hot bath does not prevent the virustaking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching covid-19. your body temperature is 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you	0

rct results do not mean (equal)change in practice. analyze the results to see whether or not they make sense to your pts. ask these 3 questions when appraising:what are the results? are the results valid? do they apply to my pts? ⁦⁦_urology⁩ ⁦⁩ 	0
 _urology  agree completely luis. clinical significance trumps stats any day.	0
  in other words, devs have the knowledge they need to make changes therefore why do we need it? to make a fuss about it? killers already send hateful messages (including death threats even!) to survivors they suspect to be swf, the community cant handle that info in short.	0
i was asked today to do this so i'll just make a poll. would you guys like a ui added for end game score screen which shows if you were against a swf? be it a 2 man, 2, 2 man, 3 man or a 4 man? i feel this would give us more data and less speculation and patterns could form.	0
 realistically, what will it prove? sure, you can gain data on swf matches versus solo but you will never know which matches those are until theyre over so would it really matter? what knowledge would be gained that isnt already known? and what would be gained from said knowledge?	0
 every match with 4 man swf has a high probability of x. every match with double swf has x probability...etc	0
 i understand that but you dont know if it's swf before a match so said knowledge wouldnt make a difference within it. beforehand, it would just be speculation therefore how would it be useful? you'd still be playing a match and getting data as you play. 1/2	0
 2/2 is said data to be used to nerf swf somehow? to prove what we already know, swf is powerful? to cast blame on a loss from? because that is how people would abuse this information. not to mention the additional abuse players would get for playing swf.	0
  hey 😁devs have all the data they want. showing some extra intel to killers would suddenly decide them to act on swf ?also, i do not get how this data could be abused ?	0
   simply put, it gives the killer peace of mind knowing that they lost due to something out of their control.	0
   it would, yes. but you have to consider the community as a whole. people get death threats for simply playing well. some people just cant handle that kind of information. if they find theyre only playing swf and losing, they wont play thus dropping sales. 1/2	0

 just an extension of the fear narrative, we actually already have the virus in us in different forms , you could also test a monkey and they would more than likely test positive , it affirms its just a virus , that's assuming everything you read is the unvarnished truth 🤔	0

 food or water contaminated. or airborne aerosols.	0
 wait...so a tiger can be tested for covid-19, but an ordinary citizen has to be near their death bed or have symptoms and prove they were in touch with someone who is already confirmed positive before they can have the test?	0

     what is the advantage of the herd immunity scenerio? most of europe &amp; asia is gradually returning to normal, but swedes are mostly banned from travel because so many of them carry a deadly disease. their strategy is terrible for their health &amp; terrible for their economy.	0
see how quickly you can find sweden on this map.... 	0
   it will take a few years to get close to herd immunity.	0
    no one knows if herd immunity can be obtained with this virus. scientists worry immunity may only last a few months. it may behave more like the coronaviruses that cause the common cold. quite the gamble with such a huge unknown.	0
     no one knows of a vaccine will be really effective or available either. you can mock the herd immunity scenario all you like but to me it's still the most logical one.	0
     as the other countries gradually opens the number of infected will gradually rise once more. no matter how careful they are. it makes no difference!	0
     no they won't if they don't reach heard immunity they will keep getting infected as the lockdown eases. it's what we're seeing now. the virus is not going to magically disappear if we stay at home. people who maintain lockdowns only delay the inevitable.	0

 this makes me so angry it is covid19  or coronavirus it is not wuhan virus and the shit could be anywhere!	0
   technically coronavirus is more correct given that it is a type of coronavirus. calling the wuhan virus is useless, uninformative and given the climate in the us just invites more trouble for asian americans.	0
   no, because it doesn't tell you anything about what it does to the body. there's a reason why the who put out guidelines for naming new viruses, although unfortunately the system is still not 100% on track.	0
   which is due to ignorance or lack of knowledge, not the name itself. spanish flu, wuhan virus, neither of these things tell you anything under examination. stop trying to justify bad naming conventions.	0

should i worry about covid-19? although illness due to covid-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. it is still quite normal for people to worry about how the covid-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.	0
i've read a lot about corona virus lately and i think i should share some highlights of the good read.it's a thread, and in form of q &amp; a.	0
are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.	0
is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019.however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.	0
is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.	0
should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19.the mask can only be used once.if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.	0
can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.	0
is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:1. smoking2. taking traditional herbal remedies 3. wearing multiple masks 4. taking self-medication such as antibiotics.	0
in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreakthread	0
"_drummond hector, i'm still trying to find ""the science"" on elimination, do you have anything to suggest elimination is even possible?giesecke indicates elimination is not possible.all i've found is this:"	0
_drummond unfortunately  it seems people 😍😍😍 lockdowns.	0
_drummond it's the micawber strategy: drifting, in the forlorn hope that something will turn up.	0
_drummond it's neither. what it is, is what it always is, preservation of political party, and that is central to the 'strategy'. ...it doesn't have to be consistent, it doesn't have to be anything at all. but it does have to keep them popular with the voters.	0
 _drummond true, but they're no longer popular with me.	0
_drummond the strategy can be found in art of war. not sun tzu’s version, rather the grand old duke of york’s version.	0
_drummond if only they’d called it organic community based immunity.	0
 _drummond immunity for the many not the few!	0
_drummond after october, when millions join the dole queue, taxes skyrocket, we plunge into a devastating recession and the suicide rate soars, lockdown will look indefensible and social distancing will be ignored by all but a minority of fannies. government policy will be irrelevant.	0
_drummond elimination - of a functioning economy, that is, and probably quite a few innocent people in the process.	0
_drummond flu will come in the winter and it will probably be called the second wave. flu effects up to 1 billion people a year - rather more than this.	0
_drummond  c19 is but a smokescreen. we are seeing an exercise in controlling the population whilst changing our laws to remove freedom of movement, choice and thought. if you don’t think what’s taking place is sinister and dangerous you haven’t been paying attention.	0
_drummond question is way too sensible &amp; therfore beyond msm so called journalists	0
_drummond got to be herd immunity because come october/november when everybody’s made up with cold what they gonna do???what we gonna do??self isolate for 2 week with a cold because of all the bedwetters!!!	0
"_drummond the former was indeed the original plan (""... when there will be less pressure on hospital beds and intensive care units due to ordinary winter flu demands.""  soon afterwards they changed to latter plan and never explained why."	0
_drummond follow the opinion polls is the strategy	0
_drummond strategy???. you poor optimist you!	0
_drummond their policy is r can't go above 1, which essentially means the latter, and they don't give a damn if they end up enforcing endless lockdowns. even though wn immunity levels have likely blocked it's growth now anyway.	0
_drummond back at the beginning the cso said elimination was impossible &amp; herd immunity, while not the policy, was the enviable end result unless we found a vaccine. merkel said the same. i’m pretty sure nobody will admit that now. labour &amp; the media would go nuts if herd immunity is back.	0
_drummond not one so called journalist has taken these bastards to task, i wish roger cook was still around, he would've fuckin' nailed them! kbf	0

what are the symptoms of covid-19?symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. but in some people it can take even longer for symptoms to appear.symptoms can include:●fever●cough●trouble breathing●feeling tired●muscle aches	0
most people have mild symptoms. some people have no symptoms at all. but in other people, covid-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death. this is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.	0
should i see a doctor or nurse?if you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to covid-19, call your doctor or nurse. you might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days	0
●you lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has information about which areas are affected. this can be found on their website: 	0
you had close contact with a person who has the virus – this generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.	0
if your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. they can tell you what to do and where to go. if you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask.	0
the staff might also have you wait some place away from other people.	0
the staff might also have you wait some place away from other people.	0
if you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead. this way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.	0
your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. they will also ask questions about any recent travel and whether you have been around anyone who might be sick.	0
will i need tests?yes. if your doctor or nurse suspects you have covid-19, they test samples of fluid taken from inside your nose and mouth. they might also do tests on a sample of mucus that you cough up, as well as your urine and stool (bowel movements).	0
your doctor might also order a chest x-ray to check your lungs.	0
"how is covid-19 treated?most people with covid-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. if you have more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""icu"")."	0
there is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions, and make you as comfortable as possible.	0
you might need extra oxygen to help you breathe easily. if you are having a very hard time breathing, you might need to be put on a ventilator. this is a machine to help you breathe.	0
can covid-19 be prevented?there are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting covid-19:●wash your hands with soap and water often.●avoid touching your face with your hands.●try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.	0
●some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of covid-19.experts do not recommend wearing a face mask if you are not sick, unless you are caring for someone who has (or might have) covid-19.	0
if someone in your home has covid-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:●keep the sick person away from others – the sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.	0
●use face masks – the sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. if you are caring for the sick person, you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room.	0
●be extra careful around body fluids – if you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear a disposable face mask, gown, and gloves. if any body fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.	0
●clean often – it's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. this includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, and bathroom surfaces.●wash hands – wash your hands with soap and water often	0
how can i prepare for a possible covid-19 outbreak?it is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. the best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.	0
if there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. if this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with covid-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.	0
there are things you can do to prepare for this. for example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. you can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.	0
this way you will be able to receive and share information easily.	0
if you or others in your family are anxious about covid-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. while it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk, try not to panic.	0
where can i go to learn more?as we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself.	0

people out here saying the covid-19 is just like the flu so why are we making it such a big deal ,while immediate risk is still considered to be low for most americans, covid-19 is still evolving at the moment symptoms range from the common cold to such potentially death 1/4	1
older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions seem to be at higher risk for developing serious illness,but doctor still don’t have a complete picture of convd-19 2/4	1
we have a healthcare system which cannot handle an influx of people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus wanting to be tested or to be treated for the virus, healthcare companies have said that they will provide free testing for the virus 3/4	1
but at the moment not for treatment. covid-19 could bring the economy to a recession. and for hundreds of millions of people who live paycheck to paycheck will not be and easy time.as of now it could be up to a year for a vaccine to be created and given to the public 4/4	1

thread about some popular myths on corona virus1. spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyapplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. disinfect surfaces not skinthese cannot kill viruses within the body!!	1
6. cats and dogs spread coronaviruscurrently, very little evidence. however, in hong kong, a pomeranian whose owner had covid-19 became infected. the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus	1
7. face masks protect against coronavirusdisposable face masks may not provide protection. yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. thus viral particles can also enter.	1
9. sars-cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldall coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.	1
9-2. thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans.	1
10. antibiotics kill coronavirusantibiotics only kill bacteria and not  viruses.	1
14. thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusthermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonscovid-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.	1
15.  flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid-19as sars-cov-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.so please dont panic, follow the govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. finally dont forget to pray. shambho mahadeva🙏	1

so what is sweden pursuing, exactly? the strategy rests on a few pillars. 1) lockdowns are wrong 2) you are delaying deaths into the future 3) we are building herd immunity 4) we can spread the virus safely debunked, one by one	0
and that's why they have always been strong opponents of lockdowns: tegnell repeatedly said there was no evidence they would work. i mean, what have the lockdowns ever done for us? 	0
and to be fair, in theory it would have been an interesting question to explore back in march: are we sure they help? but we did not have a eu-sized laboratory nor the time to get data in. we had to act first. all we had is a control group, sweden, which did not do very well	0
1) as the bbc article demonstrates, lockdowns greatly reduced the number of new cases in many countries. they saved lives, they bought us time, they contained potential superspreader events, and more	0
2) if you read the news in sweden, in march they kept repeating that all the countries that went into lockdown will face a tragic second wave, hence we were doing the right thing by carefully spreading the virus now. let's put it that statement to test, shall we?	0
denmark and norway and finland lifted their restrictions about the same days, let's use may 11th (dk and no) as the ref. one month ago. how many more deaths have occurred in scandinavia since our neighbors exited lockdowns? sw  1493 dk      74 fi        57no     22 	0
3) but we are smart, we are building herd immunity! [side note: the argument is so morally repugnant i won't even begin to unpack it, as it reeks of social darwinism, but let's try and keep it aside, albeit difficult to keep aside. anyhow let's go ahead]	0
"herd immunity my a$$. you should never allow a bunch of people who suck at math take a ""calculated risk"". it is spreading slower than much more painfully than thought before  "	0
coda: and it's not only the snapshot of today/ this week, it's the direction that is worrisome. today italy has found 202 new positive cases, sweden (1/6th of the population) 776	0
data as we stand today new cases 🇮🇹 202 🇸🇪776 new deaths 🇮🇹 71 🇸🇪67currently in icu 🇮🇹 249 🇸🇪283 sweden has 1/6 of the population	0
however, direction is important too. sweden is nowhere near limiting the spread (because, surprise, it has no intention to). *partly* because we finally started testing more, but largely because we have a lot of infections, numbers are going up, not down 	0
there is no bending the curve necessary in the fantasy land of the we-should-soon-become-immune people 	0
now, both countries have a large cfr -mortality for every 100 people found positive. and to sweden's credit they have finally started testing more (bravo!) but it's still high at 10% 	0
and our policy as it stands is *designed* to produce new infections in the range of 500-600 per day (even if you dismissed the lab in stockholm as a statistical fluke). how come swedes are accepting a magnitude of 20x the deaths of their nordic neighbors? be still, my heart	0
the nigerian government says it has secured the release of 200 schoolgirls after agreeing ceasefire with boko haram. 	1
  but military's twitter feed denies it: 	1

 follow the measures,prevent and protect yourself	0
9. can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?	0
corona virus.thread.	0
6. so, how does the disease spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.	0
7. these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.	0
8. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.	0
10. can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.	0
11. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.	0
12. what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?protection measures for everyone!stay aware of the latest information on the covid-19 outbreak, available on the who website and through your national and local public health authority.	0
13. many countries around the world have seen cases of covid-19 and several have seen outbreaks. authorities in china and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.	0
13.(a)however, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:	0
13.(b)regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.	0
13. (c)maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.why? when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.	0
13. (c)...  if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.	0

some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.	0

5. everyone with covid-19 diesthis statement is untrue. as we have mentioned above, covid-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. in fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization	1
thread about some popular myths on corona virus1. spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyapplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. disinfect surfaces not skinthese cannot kill viruses within the body!!	1
2. older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risksars-cov-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. however, anyone with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.	1
6. cats and dogs spread coronaviruscurrently, very little evidence. however, in hong kong, a pomeranian whose owner had covid-19 became infected. the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus	1
7. face masks protect against coronavirusdisposable face masks may not provide protection. yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. thus viral particles can also enter.	1
8. hand dryers kill coronavirushand dryers dont kill. only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself	1
9. sars-cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldall coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.	1
9-2. thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans.	1
10. antibiotics kill coronavirusantibiotics only kill bacteria and not  viruses.	1
14. thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusthermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonscovid-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.	1
15.  flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid-19as sars-cov-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.so please dont panic, follow the govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. finally dont forget to pray. shambho mahadeva🙏	1

   brought to you by the party that gave iran the bomb. run on that.	1
    his values are more democratic and less plutocratic	1
 every campaign has ups and downs. i worked on obamas and we had great and horrible months. it's a marathon, not a sprint.	1
  and yet sen sanders stands up for democratic party principles better than most elected democrats. weird, huh?	1
   anyone but hilary.  absolutely anyone...	1
 what was your first clue?	1
   i reckon that for hillary clinton losing the nomination to barak obama was most probably the end.	1
   be not stunned by your progress which reflects america's desire for sincere service. steward our faith.	1
     bernie casts no shade.  50 years in politics &amp; he's stood for the same things.  :)	1
 hillary can't tell the truth on anything .. in time people will see her as she is ... she is just like obama.. shady	1

  _pastor  what do these 2 results mean? the pcr (6/11) test as positive means there are rna fragments in the patient. dallas counts this as a “new case” the igg test (6/12) shows the patient is cured and now immune. the pcr can’t determine active vs. viral fragments!!! 	0
our hospitalizations for covid19 reached 400 patients today; the highest ever. think of hospitalizations as the tip of the iceberg you see and know there are a lot more undiagnosed cases in the community. go to  or my pinned tweet for dr recs to stay safe.	0
 those all covid hospitalizations, or do they include other underlying conditions?  serious question...	0
  _pastor  note, it takes approximately 14 days to generate igg, so you could not be positive for active virus/infection and positive for igg. igg is the result of your immunological success over the virus.	0
  _pastor  igg shows the pt. is healed and immune. pcr is flawed b/c it being “positive” (6/11/20 test) does not mean they actively have live virus, as pcr tests for rna fragments. but dallas county cites this as a “new case”, even though she first was a “new case” over a month ago.	0

human populations are not well-mixed &amp; homogenous, so calcs give likely upper bound. q: so what is herd immunity threshold (hit) for real pops?a: *usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.	0

  _janev3  still claiming covid-19 is just like the flu? facts are such a pain aren't they.	1
surely your not actually advocating the forced removal of “infected” people from their homes against their will? covid19 coronavirus 	1
 to separate infected from non-infected people is the only way to stop such an epidemic.	1
_janev3    selfish is the word - it's not a mental health problem you have it's a chosen attitude that disregards the need to act collectively to stop the spread of the virus	1
 _janev3   you think it’s selfish to oppose detention without trial in ‘response’ to a virus that is mild or harmless for 80-99% of those who become infected?would you be happy to see your kids or partner hauled off to a sports stadium b/c some official thinks they ‘might’ be a carrier?	1
 _janev3   no - i think it's selfish to argue people should make up their own minds about isolation and condemn many vulnerable innocent people to die. this is the problem with rabid libertarians	1
"  _janev3  do you go into voluntary isolation every year during flu season? if the answer is no, do you think you are being ""selfish"" and possibly condemning ""vulnerable innocent people to die""?"	1

 the virus can be transferred thru droplets. it can be transmitted through aerosols, if you’re in the same room as some1 &amp; they are breathing the same air, you can get the virus (masks &amp; eyewear are key). it can be transmitted through urine &amp; faeces - don’t use public toilets.	0
 the only advice for the world is don't trust who. and learn from hkprotesters and taiwan, don't believe any news from ccp,hkg and who. hk have exp from sars, which also infect by china , and ccp lie on the history, and pretend they are savior.don't let them play this trick again.	0

3. taking a hot bath doesn't prevent you from catching covid-19.4. the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites.	0
coronaviruses (cov) are a large family of mers-cov and sars-cov. coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. coronavirus disease (covid-19) is a new kind that was discovered in 2019 and hasn't been previously identified in humans. 	0
this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019. common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. in severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, and even death. 	0
5. stay home if you feel unwell. if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. follow the directions of your local health authority.6. stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider to protect yourself and others from covid-19. 	0
things that need more attention about covid-19 :1. covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.2. cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus.	0
5. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov.6. uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation.	0
7. thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have fever because of the new coronavirus infection. but, cannot detect people who are infected without fever.8. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body won't kill viruses that have already entered your body.	0
9. vaccines against pneumonia, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.10. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.	0
11. garlic may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.12. people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0
13. antibiotics don't work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and antibiotics shouldn't be used as a means of prevention or treatment.14. there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).	0

6. cats and dogs spread coronaviruscurrently, very little evidence. however, in hong kong, a pomeranian whose owner had covid-19 became infected. the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus	1
thread about some popular myths on corona virus1. spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyapplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. disinfect surfaces not skinthese cannot kill viruses within the body!!	1
2. older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risksars-cov-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. however, anyone with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.	1
7. face masks protect against coronavirusdisposable face masks may not provide protection. yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. thus viral particles can also enter.	1
8. hand dryers kill coronavirushand dryers dont kill. only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself	1
9. sars-cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldall coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.	1
9-2. thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans.	1
10. antibiotics kill coronavirusantibiotics only kill bacteria and not  viruses.	1
14. thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusthermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonscovid-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.	1
15.  flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid-19as sars-cov-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.so please dont panic, follow the govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. finally dont forget to pray. shambho mahadeva🙏	1
