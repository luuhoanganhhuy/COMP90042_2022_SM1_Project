misconceptions 1.) covid-19 is just like the flu/another strain of the flu. 2.) covid-19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu. 3.) younger individuals should not be worried about the virus.of greater concern to younger individuals, and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of covid-19 in this coming fall. (4) the reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infectall individuals, young and old and typically more virulent as well.(5) which brings me to point 4.  4.) the actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction.the prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in covid-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of covid-19 in the fall able to severelyaffect all individuals as the more covid-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) the stopping of the spread of covid-19 now is crucial to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly,immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. it should also be noted that not extending the course of the covid-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace asa result of financial need leading to increased spread. (7,8)i would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic, and i applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases.i am, however, passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases. i highly encourage everyone of you to do your research, educate yourself on how you can best help yourself, your family,and your community. the efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort. the actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come.i urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself. references1)2)3) 4) 5)6) 7)8)	1

as we reopen ohio, people will have to be very, very careful until we get a vaccine. you'll have to weigh benefit vs. risk. you will have to make sure you're wearing a mask when you go out, continue social distancing, etc. covid19 is not going away until we get a vaccine. all y’all responding that it’s your choice he’s not talking about just you. of course you can make the decision to take the risk but if you get sick it’s not just “your problem.” if the hospitals get overwhelmed that’s his problem. if you end up hospitalized and the nurse who takes care of you catches it and can’t work to help save others or worse yet becomes gravely ill or dies because of you is that still not “your problem!?” why cant we as humans care about others more than ourselves?  you’re right! numbers don’t lie! i guess i’m just confused where you are getting your numbers... 	0
15. drinking alcohol does not protect you against covid-19 and can be dangerous 14. covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates 16. being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (covid-19) or any other lung disease. 17. you can recover from the coronavirus disease (covid-19). catching the new coronavirus does not mean you will have it for life. 18. exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25c degrees does not prevent the coronavirus disease (covid-19) 19. 5g mobile networks do not spread covid-19 	0
cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus.there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the external temperature or weather.by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.to protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.pls don't panic people with fake news because it's not real all facts are in these threads 	0

  first, it’s labor, there’s no “u”, second, they were closed prevent the spread of infection, even closing prior to the mandatory shut down of non-essential services. that was a decision made by the park owners, not the qld government. criminal conduct? bullshit.  you actively want people to die? it is important or limit the spread of infection. that’s the entire point - to prevent everyone from getting it. i would hate to see a second wave, like in victoria, because infection control isn’t managed.  if herd immunity was a good idea, the federal government wouldn’t have implemented lock down measures, closed off international boarders and promoted social distancing. herd immunity results in death, it also isn’t doing great things in sweden. 	0

of course not. coronahoax if it can be found on an object surface, what can stop it to be found on food packaging? my minister say""there are no cases confirmed from food packaging"" from the cases that are currently confirmed is there a method to test where,how and when they have occurred? hello dr why can't we all get tested because it dsnt get better i'm not sure of this news about 24 dis-chem  workers i'm so scared at the moment how many customers has this virus who was at that dis-chem how long is covid 19 going to last in sa retail staff and merchies are not social distancing- they always standing together in the aisles, chatting, sharing phone screens etc. very worrying. gauteng needs total shutdown please instruct retailers to issue their staff with face masks. we cannot stay 1m away from cashiers when paying! dr, according to you, the inevitable outcome for us all is testing positive for covid-19, this means even if i test negative today i can still get it tomorrow, so how do we trust your fellow colleagues who will apparently be testing us? with pick n pay you can order online and they deliver at  your doorstep. that’s how i’ve been shopping opensa is the key to helping more people thank u minister we will do our best. i also sanitize everything i buy from the grocery shop my kids call me paranoid, maybe i am🤷🏽‍♀️ people should also learn to touh items they actualy plan on taking/buying. rather  shop_with_your_eyes must you also wash your clothes when returning from shops?

""i am israel"" simplified!  disagree? see  &amp; &gt; … …  negative. then we lose ground. we fight and take back whats ours. either they abide by our rules or they can leave.  its all so utterly petty! drives me insane! just their way of pushing sharia shit! lol re elbows ;) false   economic counter jihad is needed:  what are u kidding me they really did that? kfc :( wish i hadn't spent my money at your place today.!  they are too sensitive &amp; that's a fact, where's their tolerance?i don't eat their originally secret too damn greasy chicken     it means there is a market.shows you how many are there.  _wirral  kfc halal branches listed here rest are non-halalwhy no labels and subway 200 stores have taken pork prducts off of menur ban chicken next?    thursdayhello  tell the muslims to stop eating the darned wipes! they'll be stoping our supermarkets supplying pork next because it offends them  what a fucking joke, the colonel would be turning in his grave, if they don't like it, piss off   why do we keep pandering to these people? r u kidding me????they sure have a lot of clout here.  the ban islam crap is a bit much...the hand wipes are equally a bit much   what?  that is retarded ukip is basically just made up of former tories... nothing changes but the name  have we all gone mad? i don't eat the stuff anyway, its chickens have elbows!  some people need to get a fucking reality check   customers should ask and refuse halal . kill them economically .  i thought muslims don't eat pork? whats with the wipes? i like there biscuits....  pass the damn bacon!!  if the muslims are idiotic enough to suck on the wipes, it's their problem, not kfc's.  well said and how come they are never offended by the benefits they claim from us infidels.  ---&gt;  &lt;---- can suck it! ban muslims if they don't like what we have, well they can just move back to the hell hole they came from! r shut up!  that seems very extreme. diverse cultures have an option to partake or abstain..if u disagree- don't use them. people who eat in kfc's are the sort of people who make love to vacuum cleaners.     read the article properly,it was a member of staff..read american style chicken offends me...  has to be british or is like sponsoring terrorists  have you noticed the lack of skin on chicken portions in your local smkt.?  ffs, the kfcs in mid east give out wet wipes (in my limited experience of mid east kfcs). uk gone mad  priv. corp so not a big deal in my mind. they need to accommodate the market share they want.  check out chick-fil-a must better than kfc what's next? a burqa for the colonel? no female employees? why not tofu chicken so as not to offend peta?   - yes! stamp it out now or it really will be too late. it's a terrible story, it really is. i never saw animal rights activists protest halal - the most cruel method to kill animals/birds for meat  dumb question:  why do muslims hate alcohol?  ban it in hospitals too, horrible stuff, tried all sorts of mixers with it too  the religion of islam sucks. so does christianity and mormonism  there's alcohol in them ? they give them away free. result  demand bacon at kfc!    freemarinea kentucky fried cr*p! fed up of having other religions rammed down my throat if i wanted to be a muslim i would become one. kfc off my list then cheers  i am an american offended by obama  just how ridiculous can we get! this all pisses me off.  tell them to go home if they don't like how we live.  (i'm vegie anyhow )  erm... i think islamic world pioneered use of alcohol for medical purposes. it's consumption that's forbidden.   you guys are turning into france. wipes are not required to be used, are they? smile, tell the fussies where the dry napkins are, and who can i help next?  the once great british empire will be dirt roads and mud huts in a hundred years, if not sooner.  it's not consumable alcohol? ie ethanol. what's next screenwash?  that's right patriot. we need to let the corporates who really is in charge in america; that being we the american people.  a muslim leader said banning of wipes was bizarre and kfc have apologised so no need to stop visiting. kfc is disgusting anyway.  that's the main reason to ban them.  dafuq? they don't even know the diff between rubbing alcohol and drinking alcohol? rl idiocracy. what kind of drivel is this you're spouting?  there he boycotted alcohol wipes zibidi get deported! not aware of that religion from the   thats exactly why the problem exists because people have, i for one have had enough. when in rome  stupid if an alcohol wipe offends then i guess they should just use their shit covered hands to eat the halal crap.  it already is, when the likes of anjem chowdry freely roam the streets of londonistan!   why boycott them over a staff members mistake? not policy?  you need the wipes for greasy chicken.  (a) it was a halal kfc (think kosher), targeted to muslim customers, not a regular kfc; (b) it was staff error  isn't it rubbing alcohol?  the stuff that'll make you go blind you if you drink it?  wow!!! they didn't tell them that the chicken is cooked in pig lard???? lmao   never use the place so won't get rich on me!!!freemarinea😄😄!  i'll overlook it as long as they come through with those kentucky fried pork rinds they've been planning.    had free  food at the kc on saturday, avoided that hal al shite! this is stupid though. muslims just can't consume alcohol, there's nothing wrong with hand wipes containing alcohol!?"	1

@_sh4 ny/nj/ct continue to trend down in daily new cases even as many other states have either stopped their downward trend or inflected upward since the mass protests started. estimates of prevalence are 20-25%, well below the herd immunity threshold. so what is going on?@_sh4 ... is an issue, but i am not sure the situation warrants the kind of hopelessness and unpredictability conveyed here. to paraphrase jonathan haidt, this is the coddled american mind... the preamble of political opinions about masks, etc. makes me wonder if the hopelessness, as you point out, is intended to make a political point. it seems like a tactic to scare ppl into wearing masks.@_sh4 yeah those were the elements that made me think that. btw speaking of your contempt for epidemiologists there is something very interesting going on that they need to get into the bottom off ...@_sh4 it is not just mask compliance. i have noticed in nj increasing socialization and crowding in public places as the state has reopened. yet we don't detect a pickup in cases. could it be that herd immunity can be reached at lower levels than thought or perhaps seroprevalence ...@_sh4 ... estimates are missing true infection attack rates? it is quite puzzling but i see no attempts to engage with it by epidemiologists.	0
" what is wrong with this guy?  we have plenty of testing.  so much testing that sites shut down from lack of demand.  the goalposts constantly shift for team apocalypse.  no amount of testing, serology testing, contact tracing, anything will satisfy their desire for ""safety.""no. a just government protects our rights. you want a mommy to care for you. america was founded by men who wanted to live free.   and the stupid thing about testing is that if a person is found not to have the virus that day, he could get it the next, so it's pretty pointless.  their retort to that would be,  ""well then we need even more testing.  serology testing.  no reopening until we have a vaccine.  two more weeks until the healthcare system collapses!""  there's just no reasoning with them, which makes this all the more frustrating."	0

myths about the corona virus1. taking ice cream and other cold foods do not facilitate or aid the onset of the disease.2. taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease.3. the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted via mosquito bites. 4. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.5. thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.5. thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.6. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces,but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.7. antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.8. to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.	0

"_ego1488   my question is why do we need to have a desert cult faith anyway? regardless of anything jesus may have said or done, why do we need it? why not use our own religion that we've used since our beginning? i didn't vote in 2016.  trump has a fanatical fan base of judeo-christians.  what can you do in a nation where over 80% of boys are circumcised as infants because...""muh bible says so duuude""   (1) jesus forbid circumcision even if he was circumcised against his will.it's the protestants who reintroduced it because they follow judaïsm and not catholicism which by the way was 100% anti judaïsm until the free-masons infiltrated it and changed it from the inside during  (2) the renaissance.the americans are the most stupid and evil people on earth, nothings to do with religions, they are the sewer of europe, the worst of the worst, convicts, rapists, murderers, crooks, etc  (3) europe didn't want them and unfortunately didn't exterminate them, instead they sended them to the new world (new jerusalem) and since then they fuck up the world even more than the jews.  (4) i'm not christian but jesus hated the jews, that's why they had him killed, christianism is a poison yes but jesus was not part of it, he was a jew who hated his own race like so many more jews...   we don't need to have a desert cult faith, i never said that, we only need to get rid of (((them))) once and for all and varg is right but the problem is even without christianism, the jews will still control us, they are everywhere, not just in christianism"	0

i. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.d. how can i protect myself you can protect yourself by:-  washing your hands with soap and running water frequently : before and after eating, after using toilet, touching animals or animal waste- covering mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing- avoiding close contact with anyone who shows symptoms.- seek medical care if you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing.trending coronavirusoutbreak- have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care- do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick- are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected coronavirus infectiong. how to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask •before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.•cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.•avoid touching the mask while using it;•replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use is advised.h. does the new coronavirus affect older peoplepeople of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virushowever, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.j. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support.the goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.	0
 is this evidence that herd immunity is ultimately needed? if you have a series of lockdowns followed by a series of new peaks - what is the point of lockdown?for countries like bulgaria that locked down incredibly early, prevented much of a spread at all and then reopened, the renewed spike puts them in an awkward position.   unfortunately untrue: if you do herd immunity it’s going to get out of control within an instant which will overwhelm the icu units especially in a country like america which only has a healthcare system for the rich. even germany was on the brink of exhaustion in nrw region  not in the uk with our expanded capacity	0
can eating garlic help prevent the virus?garlic does have antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from outbreak that garlic has protected people from the virus.does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?common questions about covid-19 can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps shouldn’t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause cell deaths. how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever because of infection with the virus.they can’t detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. due to it taking between 2-10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the virus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, do not provide protection against the virus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.can rinsing your nose with saline help prevent the virus?no. there is no evidence that rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from the virus. there is some limited evidence that rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold.people of all ages can be infected by covid-19. older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. are antibiotics effective in treating the virus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.all sources are from the world health organisation website. everything i’ve posted has been approved and factually checked. source credit: 	0

  but what is herd immunity is much easier to attain than expected? this virus doesn’t grow exponentially.  don't put words in my mouthi m concerned about the public health aspects first, economy second (like 70% of america, btw, data available by request). here in ct we shut down, got control, and like most in the northeast are opening slowly and with cautions like masks built in  this is what i want  what i see coming from you (and friends) is economy &gt; public health and so to get there, and justify that order of importance (since 120k have died), the virus is downplayed.younger infection is goodherd immunity is the way to goetcpublic health docs don't agree  in my view, the way to help the economy is to get control of the virus, not vice versaand so 'you just want to close the economy' is false. it's a partisan charge.i want to control the virus to open the economyvaccine is the power tool in the toolbox not the only tool. /fin  it grows exponentially. that's what's happening in az right now before your eyes.it would be great if herd if immunity was real and easy to achieve. that takes ~70% of the population assuming we're immune after infection (unproven, it's not true for other coronaviruses). but..	0

how does covid-19 spread?🤧 people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. 💦 the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.🥄 these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. 👈 other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. ↔️ people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 whocoughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  whowhatsapp	0

  you need to also consider that may are not tested due to widespread test shortage and the ~80% accuracy of the results. the m.e. is the one that lists cause of death on the death cert. and they are about 8 weeks behind. the numbers are certainly much higher than can be reported.  if you cannot test accurately, you cannot get derive any numbers with accuracy that are predicated on positive results. the numbers are high, and even now the majority of people are distancing. death count is not very important. long term health problems are very important.  btw - we are not testing for asymptomatic. we do not have enough test except for the serious suspects and those awaiting surgeries/procedures.  you don't die from any virus. you die from problems that resulted from contracting the virus and effects on the systems of the body. example: acute myocarditisyou don't die from a motor vehicle accident. you die from the result of the mva. example: hypovolemic shock	0

part 3what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. frediboatpart 5older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.frediboatpart 6how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. frediboatpart 7these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19part 8who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    frediboatpart 9can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?”part 10can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, frediboatpart 11many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  frediboatpart 12who is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of covid-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    frediboatpart 13can i catch covid-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?the risk of catching covid-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. while initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this frediboatpart 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak. who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. frediboatpart 15because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eatingfrediboatpart 16what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?protection measures for everyonestay aware of the latest information on the covid-19 outbreak, available on the who website and through your national and local public health authority. frediboatpart 17many countries around the world have seen cases of covid-19 and several have seen outbreaks. authorities in china and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. however, the situation is unpredictable so check regularlyfrediboatfor the latest news.part 18you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.why?

droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such aspart 22cold, flu and covid-19.stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. follow the directions of your local health authority.why? national and local authorities will frediboatpart 23have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.frediboatpart 24keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely). if possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.why? frediboatpart 25you have a higher chance of catching covid-19 in one of these areas.**********protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where covid-19 is spreadingfollow the guidance outlined above (protection measures for frediboatpart 26everyone)self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 c or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. if it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or frediboatpart 27to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.why? avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible covid-19 frediboatpart 28why? calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. this will also help to prevent possible spread of covid-19 and other viruses.frediboatpart 29how likely am i to catch covid-19?the risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a covid-19 outbreak unfolding there.for most people in most locations the risk of catching covid-19 is still low. however, there are now places aroundpart 30the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. for people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching covid-19 is higher. governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of covid-19 is identified. be sure topart 31comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading covid-19.covid-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in frediboatpart 32china and some other countries. unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. it’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. who publishes daily updates on the covid-19 situation worldwide.you can see these at 	0

q: what can i do to protect myself from covid19?a: practice good hygiene: ✅ wash your hands✅ cover coughs/sneezes with tissue/elbow—not your hands✅ don't touch eyes/nose/mouth✅ clean surfaces often✅ stay home when sick✅ avoid sick peopleℹ️   how does avoiding sick people help during the 20+ day asymptomatic transmission period?  if you want ppl to stay home when they're sick, you need to mandate paid sick time to all part and full time workers in the state. when most of us live paycheck to paycheck staying home isn't an option.	0

how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with ++covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms.this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.why?when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.why?hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately.why?droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and covid-19. stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.follow the directions of your local health authority.why? national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely). if possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++diabetes, heart or lung disease.why? you have a higher chance of catching covid-19 in one of these areas.for more information, please contact us. ✨e-mail: info.combgghealthcare health healthy healthylifestyle healthcare coronavirus coronaturkey covid19	0

how does covid-19 spread?at the moment, we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets. droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing.as of today, 169,906 covid-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in 6,644 fatalities worldwide. after its discovery last december, in wuhan, china, the virus started to spread around the world, causing panic.how do the seven humancoronaviruses differ?the main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. the first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while sars and mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity.how do viruses work?a virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. it enters the cell through binding with receptors and “reprogrammes it” to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body.the virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection.there are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. but this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty.how deadly is the new coronavirus compared to sars, mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold?we cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed.also, with covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.the mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal.it is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for sars-cov-2 is higher.although compared to sars (9.6 per cent) and mers (34.4 per cent), covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger.can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus?for some respiratory viruses this does happen. not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. in this case, it is still premature to say.	0

when this pandemic infected 26 of the population worldwide, it made me fear for my life. but now? it infected more than a hundred thousands of people, millions of people to be exact. what is “covid-19” anyway? it is a crisis that we all should take seriously. this pandemic, i became productive. i learned how to decipher codes, i get to watch a lot of animes and read many books. i am happy because i get to spend more time with my family like, watching movies, eating together and talked and talked about everything.this pandemic started and the true face of the people also started to unmask. some families doesn’t have a proper home, some doesn’t have the stable job to provide the need for their family, and some doesn’t have the privilege to protect themselves during this pandemic.what about them? there are people that are hoarding the necessities, to what? to benefit you from preventing the virus? to re-sell it at a higher price? these people didn’t even think about the people who doesn’t have enough money to buy enough necessities for their family. to be honest, i got mad at them. during this pandemic, i also realized how bad our government is. the president didn’t even bother to tell us the plan at an early time, instead he ordered the police and soldiers to kill everyone not obeying the rules. i mean????? the people not obeying the rules are hungry, they are waiting for the relief goods that was supposed to be distributed as soon as possible but nothing was distributed. i also realized that no matter how bad and irresponsible you are, if you have a position at the government and if you are rich, you can wander freely everywhere, spreading the virus and still be given compassion that you don’t deserve. this pandemic made me aware of the issues of what’s really happening. it angers me a lot, to be honest because if you don’t have the privilege, you are going to be ignored like a pest. that’s how dirty the government works.we already have the highest number of covid-19 cases in southeast asia with minimal testing. without testing, we’re acting blind &amp; exposing the vulnerable— old, poor, and the jobless. i think that there will be no choice but to extend this lockdown. we should all cooperate during this lockdown. the government should provide our needs and necessities to prevent people from going outside. we can overcome this situation by cooperating and puting our faith to god and the frontliners. we also should give our biggest salute to our frontliners, not only they are giving their absolute best, but they are staking their lives as well. reine elyssa g. fodra stem 11-03	0

   _vogel     what is it for normal flu? guessing it's pretty high. given the extremely low average mortality rate for covid-19 i'd expect the nnt to be over 10,000, maybe much higher once herd immunity is reached worldwide. residual panic will no doubt help with sales.   _vogel     agree meredith. but when herd immunity takes over, it will have fewer hosts. my belief is that immunity from a real infection is greater than that achieved from a vaccine. covid is so contagious that herd will occur prior to a vaccine.	0

what is haseltine talking about? this is simply wrong. the common cold coronaviruses confer immunity for several months to several years, about 2 years on average. seems to also completely confuse the concept of herd immunity with just immunity. wtfdifficult to see this as anything but alarmism and sensationalism. we are ~7 months into this pandemic with all eyes on this virus, and there is still not a single example of sars-cov-2 reinfection reported.	0

  red..you are better than this... so how is obama responsible for mass shootings when he has tried multiple times to put gun laws in place? two statistics that have nothing to do with eachother lol  this is so besides the point of what happen...the bigger picture is being missed. bush - 9/11. end discussion. bollocks to this figure. ...355 mass shootings in the us this year so it must be obama's fault. genius deduction columbo. this is by far the stupidest tweet ever. oh my... the usa= all of them yeah because there couldn't possibly be any other factors involved than the president.  that's sarcasm by the way. its worse than that i'm afraid. there has actually been 355 mass shootings in 2015 alone. worse, most irrelevant statistic on twitter today. this may be true, but  will just say it's bush jr's fault. he inherited the mess. noleadership wakeupamerica and this list means what?_86  both of those incidents under obamas control. he is the great divider. don't forget to add bush invasion to irak trigger isil.  wonder why it's higher with dem presidents? anybody have a clue? amount of lives lost under w 9/11 attack? correlation does not equal causation. grow up.	1

 just for the record, see the who advice (under “is there anything i should not do?”):“*in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early* to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection...” (emphasis theirs) or you sit at home, develop symptoms that need greater care, and die.the opposite of “don’t panic” is not “don’t go to the doctor”.it’s certainly not “book a cruise, because screw other people”. yuh huh. and nobody’s saying go for a cough. i’m saying your “nothing they can do except in the most severe cases” advice is horseshit.most severe means icu. plenty of people need medical care at much less extreme levels. why do you assume you know better than the vast majority of the world’s public health experts?	0

what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 1/3let´s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. let´s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. so here´s a thread of q&amp;a on coronaviruses (covid-19) from world health organization.covidfreeaprilcovidfreephilippinescovidfreeworldwhat is a coronavirus?coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers, sars and now, covid-19.what is covid-19?covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

thread on covid19 spread &amp; testing.how does covid-19 spread?it spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. close contact, which is being closer than 6 feet for more than 10 minutes w/a sick individual, increases your risk of catching it. (1/12) covid19us … individuals with severe illness from covid-19 may need hospital care, which would still be supportive care of symptoms because there is no specific treatment for the disease… (5/12)covid19us… whether you are positive or negative, we ask that people stay home for 72 hours after their symptoms end to avoid passing illness to others… (6/12)covid19us… if you test positive for covid-19, you will need to stay home for 7 days after your positive test or for 72 hours after your symptoms end, whichever is longer… (7/12)covid19us… this is different from flu, which has a specific antiviral medication that can be given if a flu test is positive. no specific treatment for covid-19 = no different care after a positive test result. (8/12)covid19uswho gets tested? how?anyone with symptoms can go to a healthcare provider. if the provider decides a test is needed, they can collect specimens and request a test from the state lab or order one from a commercial lab… (9/12)covid19us… working with a provider is very important—a cough and fever can have many causes, so seeing a provider will help you get an answer about cause and treatment… (10/12)covid19us… there is no specific treatment for covid-19, so if your symptoms are from some other cause, it’s important that you’re working with a provider who can help you get well. (11/12)covid19usstill have questions? follow  or visit  (12/12)📷: my kid is/i am coughing. should i ask for testing?contact a healthcare provider if you or your child has symptoms such as cough, fever, or shortness of breath. children typically have milder symptoms, more like a common cold… (2/12)covid19us… treatment will not change based on a positive covid-19 test. positive or negative, treatment will be fluids, fever-reducing medication, rest, or other supportive care for symptoms… (3/12)covid19us… there is currently no treatment specific to covid-19, so a positive test result only indicates the cause of illness, not any type of treatment… (4/12)covid19us	0

 from who info page. is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19. in what way? this one spreads far quicker, and it has already reached far more people than sars did. also, it takes 4 to 5 weeks to die, and so nobody knows the fatality death rate yet. right off, his data is wrong. it started early december - not the 29th december. also the world health orgaization says it's worse than sars. if a disease only spreads to a thousand people, and it kills 10%, that is only a 100 dead. if a disease spreads to 5 million people, and it kills 3% (current fatality rate), it kills 30,000 people. it is the ease of spreading that makes it more dangerous. i would still put that on par with a bad flu bug, most people don't die from it and that fatality percentage can change based on how it's reacted to and where geographically you look.  with proper prevention this won't result in a pandemic. yes, i know that. but it takes approximately 5 weeks from the date of manifestation of the illness (not the incubation period) to die. most people have not recovered yet. so the death rate might be a lot higher. the fact that sars didn't spread easily means it was less dangerous.	0

 _paul  what is the solution then? can't go for herd immunity it would kill too many based on a 0.5-1% ifr , can't rely on a vaccine that may or may not come, does aggressive track and trace actually work? i'm not sure it does. i think it's the asymptomatic spreaders that are the problemin italy, fatalities have been under 100 every day in june. still far too many, but down from 900 at the peak.just 163 new infections were reported yesterday.they first eased their lockdown at the start of may. the progress is encouraging for one of my favourite countries. what's going on in china it is a bit worrying_paul  the question is, how are they getting a resurgence? it seemed like they had eliminated it. where had it been hiding? someone who had it for a very long time? maybe a resovoiur in the body? _paul  makes it impossible to lock the virus down.	0

   what is humorous about herd immunity?florida gov  says state officials are making psas targeting younger floridians who have let their guard down abt spread of covid-19. median age of coronavirus cases in broward is now 33 yrs old. in duval, 30. in hillsborough co, it’s 31. in seminole, it’s 26 yrs old    and we achieve herd immunity before the fall flu season.   super funny til someone you know gets it and dies.   not a damn thing; it's deadly serious. a lot of people would have to die in short order to get there quickly. you need 60-70% to achieve. i frankly don't feel like sacrificing a large percentage of people over 60 to do it. 🤷🏽‍♀️   data is showing that the best way to avoid infecting the at-risk 60+ population is don’t put covid patients in nursing homes. the median age infected in the counties listed were all below 35. that’s exactly where you want the immunity to build.	0
covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.from the evidence so far, the covid-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus.there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°c to 37°c, regardless of the external temperature or weather. the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. more info who:    _ke _kenya  _igad     but can it thrive in the same conditions    _ke _kenya  _igad         _ke _kenya  _igad     just when i was starting to feel invincible in kituior travel to an area reporting covid-19. the best way to protect yourself against covid-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.	0

can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.world health organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. 	0

 and what do you mean “not during a global pandemic?” did the pandemic just end?! did i just completely miss that? the way people were talking these “protests” will result in many more deaths from the coronavirus alone. it’s disgusting and hypocritical to think these “protests” &gt; do you hear yourself?? the riots have way more people in close proximity to each other than we’ve seen in months. it’s far more important now than ever to enforce that. not only are so many people not social distancing, but they’re also causing destruction. are 100% fine when literally one week ago if there was any gathering even 10% the size of some of these it would have been ground upon and shut down immediately. this hyposcriscy needs to end.	0

trump says covid-19 is just like the flu. flu mortality is about 14.3 per 100,000 cases.covid-19 mortality is currently 3,400 per 100,000 cases.they are not the same and trump cannot be trusted to protect us. right! last year 63k people died of flu. if it had been covid19 that number would have been over a million. i was saying that frequently to liberals about a week ago because it was a popular anti-anti-vaxer taking point.i really dislike hyper partisan people.	1

"what is herdimmunity threshold for covid19?a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp; huge consequences for long term impact. new paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially (spoiler: we still don't know value). thread.human populations are not well-mixed &amp; homogenous, so calcs give likely upper bound. q: so what is herd immunity threshold (hit) for real pops?a: *usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.background: if we know reproductive number r0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (hit) for well-mixed homogenous population is simply 1-1/r0. (note r0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space).1) if some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering hit. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).2) if some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces hit. 3)if some people don't transmit that also reduces hit.positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.however, see paper by  that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than science paper cited above. fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects hit, f, for r0=3; so hit=0.66, f = 0.94. science paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces hit. it considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.the strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. the citation they give is not a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ matlab files. it's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there.  can probably provide best onesthe take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. not well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential ""activity"" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce hit for r0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43. the conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value. what i find puzzling is that this paper is in science. it's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. it isn't as general as  paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. many older papers say same thing. paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on hit, f based on data (colored lines in figure). in idealized population, early vaccination to hit will prevent outbreak b/c rt=r0*s/n so rt&lt;1. however, an epidemic will overshoot hit &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*r0)). for r0=2.5 (reasonable for covid19 in some pops), hit=0.6, and f = 0.89.these simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led  to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70% of pop would get infected without interventions. most articles cited the 70% *but*  knew that...i'd like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. but ...serological data from nyc suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or r0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20% - i added horiz dashed line). together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;1-1/r0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1-exp(-(f*r0)), but by how much is still unknown. ugh.  smartly gave a wide range 40-70% (20-60% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions.unfortunately, uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for hit for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does r0). the take home message is want to get to hit by vaccination not infection. are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from hiv or stis with highly stratified risk groups)?covid19 yes. see link at end to interview with  that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial.  did some work on this in 2007 or so also when i recall correctly: “""a programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available.""_leenders  this is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial).  do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has, how long it lasts?  not yet, sadly!  without reading: the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading.   unroll please salam, please find the unroll here: : what is herdimmunity threshold for covid19? a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp;…  talk to you soon. 🤖  ""what is this about nerd immunity?""  assumptions about heterogeneity are just that, assumptions. but there is plenty of convincing evidence that slow down in spread is strongly linked to lockdowns; despite high levels of infection. thus heterogeneity is likely less than the models predict.

is covid-19 airborne?? the cdc has stated it's potentially airborne, although i don't know if there's anything concrete the other two coronaviruses, mers and sars, i believe, were indeed airborne tho research so far seems to indicate the virus can survive up to 3 hours in tiny droplets suspended in air, making airborne transmission plausible. main form of transmission seems to be physical contact between people or transmission through intermediary of another solid surface.	0

are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?no. hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-ncov. to protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites.to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.however, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.pls don't panic people with fake news because it's not real all facts are in these threads 	0
 when can we expect the full results from this survey so we can interpret comprehensive results with proper context? or do we just wait for you to selectively release sections to support the most convenient narrative of the day?lot's of folks claiming school choice only benefits the wealthy, but our survey of albertans would disagree. students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended every choice of education. the percentages were pretty consistent as well.education choice benefits all. abed  this is rhetorical of course because the survey was so inadequately prepared and questions so leading that it was a rigged method to gather the biased responses you wanted.  there is a wealth of research evidence that shows, for example, the devastating effects of summer learning loss on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. having publicly-funded charter schools able to innovate and respond to these issues is making things better for kids.	0

fact - cdc estimates that covid-19 may be 10x those numbers. i get tired of retweeting that because so many are tied to the distraction claims of the trump gop who’ve battered msm making comparative claims that covid-19 is just like the flu. it’s misleading the public!  that is what we keep hearing, but the numbers of deaths do not support that so far. i freely admit that i am just a dumbass, but 23,000 deaths so far seems a lot more important that the few we've seen from the coronavirus to me.  early days. not enough tested yet.	1

"":an openly gay said - he and met with pope a day before kim davis did _rdz  so do you think he needs man or woman for sex? what do you want a cookie? who cares who was first? did pope give the gay couple his blessing? and tell em to keep up the fight! it was an old friend of the pope who happened to be gay. vatican is trying to spin this as cover over secret meeting w/kim davis you're a trip. pretty sure his boss once met with tax collectors and prostitutes.  walklikejesus is this the catholic churches attempt to look neutral  when it comes to gay rights? cause i'm not buying it... bet kim ain't smilin anymore. and what does that prove or matter?_krieg  because the pope loves all humans as does jesus even those we may disagree with that is christian love pour gas on the fire baby. just let it go... i've had enough of the gay talk show-offs! i don't get all that squeak! so pope can meet gay people, but can't meet kim davis? i smell hypocrisy or stupidity here. who cares? why did the pope even waste his time meeting kim davis?  kim davis should be back in jail, not meeting with the pope/reporters. no one can trust this pope. now we're sure. did he also meet an openly woman woman - maybe an openly man manwas the pontiff openly catholic?"	0

 why do we need it? it’s based on what facts? yes the founding fathers were white, males, and many owned slaves. probably a few were gay. so what! but a play to re-engineer the truth?      a theater director at harvard university announced this week that she will produce an all-female and lgbt version of the classic musical, 1776. the production is scheduled to debut on broadway in the spring of 2021.         what if it’s a comedy?  do you think people will figure out that a broadway musical is not intended to teach history?        no too stupid! hamilton has a largely black cast and they portray historical figures that owned slaves yet quote them as righteous people. teachers have to teach the truth not liberal make believe facts. like george washington owned slaves!	0
   i understand that you need to give boilerplate health advice. but my point is: if the results of tests are taking a week how useful is that for someone who is asymptomatic who is not able to isolate to wait for the results?when can we expect testing with a faster turnaround?   re: cha free covid testingif one is non-symptomatic and it takes 5+ days after a covid test to find out the results, how useful is that delayed test result to prevent that person from spreading the virus?my goal before doing a week of vacation and visiting a few people at the end of july is to get tested before i go. but if i'd need to get tested 5-8 days before leaving, is this even a useful exercise? if the people you are visiting are vulnerable, it would be good to get a negative test and then isolate until you see them.     residents tested at a cambma mobile site or cha's east cambridge site receive results from . these sites are not designed to help residents make real-time decisions about visits or vacations; they are mainly intended for those w/symptoms or who think they were exposed   . calls residents within 1-2 days of receiving the test result. if people do not answer the phone or return the call that day, it takes longer to reach them. to find out the status of test results, leave a message at 617-665-3848 &amp; you will receive a callback.	0

"1.15 million americans have been killed by guns since john lennon's death  that's totally fucked up.  might even be an understatement. 35 years ago, we lost a legend. today marks the anniversary of john lennon's passing. unbelievable it's not the gun that killed them. it was the idiot in control of it! its not the pencil's fault you fail the test oh right. you prefer pressure cooker bombs. mostly black on black. still a tragedy, but they need to decide that black lives matter. mostly by muslims, in donald trumps head. how many have done marijuana? 1.475 million have been killed in motor vehicle accidents. yet we still sell/drive cars.  and how many other foreigners have been killed by american guns around the world?i don't normally share things like this, but this is absolutely devastating...   how many killed since some other famous random person died that's a shame. ""all we are saying, is give gun control a chance""johnlennon    that is why  continuously asking congress 2pass anti-gun law, he doesn't want more american to be killed  john lennon is hardly some random famous person. 1.15 million deaths in 35 years by one cause is a lot. break down the numbers: 2013 - 21,175 by suicide with a firearm / 11,208 deaths by homicide - paints a different picture."	0

"first, what is a coronavirus? ulmer: this particular strain started in wuhan province. it traveled from animals to humans.she said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first.panelists:beaumont public health director sherry ulmerbeaumont emergency management coordinator tim ocnashekbisd assistant superintendent of elementary education anita frankfrom beaumont psychiatric clinic, jason mensahulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in beaumont or jefferson county.she said she doesn't want to downplay the flu. with both viruses, the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised.""we're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu.""""if we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us.""she notes because covid-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine.ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in texas, but mensah says there are 51.ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold.i'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. i know (thanks to thedaily i think) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia.so, mild is relative here.ulmer said she's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine.she says that's why it's important to continue ""tried and true"" healthcare methods. wash your hands, stay home when you're sick.clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays.lysol, clorox and 409 are cdc-approved to kill the virus.""we understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours.""feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread. he gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. he's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days.ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. the virus is transmitted person-to-person. she says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets.that's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing.ulmer said the health department is putting together ""soemthing"" so people know what the next step is if jefferson county has a confirmed case.(i'm going to use tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.)so ... tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures. that includes limiting crowds, increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1/2measures. i would like to add, as of friday, the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds. the comment was at this time, danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken. 2/2tim says ""we're not trying to scare people. there's a lot of bad information out there.""he encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on facebook or from friends and spreading it like it's a fact.""we would encourage people to be patient because it's a fluid situation."" - feldshauhe notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. however when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming.ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. and several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them.""we are as prepared as we can be with the information we're getting. of course it's fluid, but we're accustomed to these types of situations.""reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.she said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are ""doing very well.""""for our children it sounds like god has smiled on us.""now talking about ""flattening the curve."" people are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.""this is not here today and gone tomorrow."" -feldschauulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would ""tax our healthcare system."" should the city/county get there, it would have to look at ""alternative"" ways to treat people. she didn't expand on what those alternatives are.she said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.""i we know that you're coming, the staff can be ready for you. they can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus."" 2/2feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.""if we ever lose control, we're going to have a serious problem.""from comment section on the video: ""if this virus is just like the flu &amp; spreads like viruses do (airborne) i’m not understanding the panic &amp; closure of so many things? what is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don’t do it for flu?""this seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments. someone simply responded ""yassss"" and another said people don't know what to do ""so they just shut everything down i guess.""so even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ..."	0

6: how does covid-19 spread? a: we are learning more and more about how covid-19 spreads. evidence originally was very strong that it was present in the droplets of people who were infected. when those people cough or sneeze the virus can be transmitted to others who breathe in the virus or if their hands become contaminated with the virus and then they touch their face.there is more evidence that the virus lives on surfaces for long enough periods of time to be transmitted up to several days later. people who have no symptoms are also able to spread the virus.this is part of the reason it is very hard to contain and slow the spread of covid-19 without taking the current measures of social distancing. 	0

@_kjkelly  i'm not at all suggesting that covid-19 is just like the flu. it is clearly worse both in terms of transmission rates (r0) and mortality rates. but these charts are trying to show how it's an order of magnitude worse. even with seasonal flu vaccine widely administered.  yes, they do, though it is incomplete and provisional, as it can take months for all of the death certificate data to the cdc from the states. here is chart of weekly pneumonia deaths  through april 4. pneumonia deaths are spiking, as one would expect.   source: data for the week of april 5-11 is vey incomplete, so not plotted. it's already high, however. @_kjkelly  so week of feb 1 total deaths 56589 (0 covid-19); week of april 4 (highest covid-19 deaths, 5457) total deaths 52992.so while covid-19 ramps up the overall death count drops? @_kjkelly final orders of magnitude won't be known for a long time. so much under counting of cases/deaths it's hard to tell and without testing everyone it's impossible to know for sure. it could still end up 5x or 10x worse than seasonal flu at the end of the day.  the flu vaccine doesn't affect sars-cov-2. if we had a vaccine, we wouldn't be on lockdown.	1

do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov. although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?no. sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. there are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-ncov on surfaces. these include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.however, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. it can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov). older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

 why do we need it?  what happens to the decades of teaching?nearly every country in the world has hopped on the metric bandwagon. the u.s. is one of three holdouts.   outside of science classes because to be functionally literate in science you must know your si units or at least how to convert out of them.  and if you want to talk about a waste of instructional time, teaching unit conversions is it.  only necessary because of the us antiquated system.  we through out the years of learning and teach the metric system in 5 minutes. that’s all it takes to learn because it is better. i want aliens to visit the us. but they would think our county alone is so dumb we can’t be with visiting. that is how important the metic system is.  we were taught the metric system in florida. in the 4th grade. i think we’d fine.	0

 interesting hypothesis. what is the certainty % of the herd immunity assessment? probability of second northeast wave this fall is extremely low?  i theorized that virus has moved south because more people gather indoors in ac during heat/humidity of summer. are we seeing a large increase in cases in other large blm protest areas? pa? nyc? nj? chicago? i haven’t checked but my suspicion would be no because i think the virus has already burned its way through the northeast. i don’t see it coming back.i cover that here if you’re interest still gompertz function here, you think? regional outbreaks?  i think that all those gompertz states are in the clear. rest of the country still susceptible this is not my theory, this is work done by nobel laureate michael levittso far the data supports this theory. all we can do is follow the data and see where it takes us.	0

 might be more of a thing since the 2000s but it’s every game these days. what do you mean “envious of being part of that level of connection” by the way? envious of another club getting that result, of course but “level of connection”? haha. curious, do you ever join in with sign on? not for me. would you join in with rent boys? the only chelsea game i attended was the one where zola got tactically subbed after you had a player sent off in the 1st half {we won 4-1}, sometime in the late 90s. i was in kop pretty much middle. i don’t know how old that chant is but i don’t remember hearing it. i wouldn’t... sing it anyway. they’re not compatible chants — sign on gets sung {inaccurately sung in a lot of places} because ynwa is a such fun song to sing. churlish not admit that most neutrals watching the 4-0 barca game aren’t envious of being a part of that level of connection. i mean an all encompassing ‘fun to sing, meaningful, world famous song that spills over and is mentioned in other sports’ kinda way. sign on has been sung for decades and it’s so old now that the lyrics {before covid job losses} are out of date beyond all recognition... it doesn’t wind scousers up, it just’s just funny when people from burnley etc sing it to them. i almost pity rival fans who sing it. so to that end, i honestly believe that it’s just sung because they hear it at anfield and dortmund and celtic etc, and vicariously want in.	0
"how does covid-19 spread?initially, experts believe the virus started out in animals in wuhan, china; and was then transmitted to humans. the current version of the sars-cov-2 spreads from person-to-person, similar to the flu. this usually happens when a sick person coughs orwhat is covid19?coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. they have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov).in december 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in wuhan, china.the virus was previously termed “ncov-2019”. at the beginning of 2020, the virus was officially named sars-cov-2, due to its similarities to the previoussars-cov. the disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the who as coronavirus disease 2019, or “covid-19”.sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters).what are the symptoms of covid-19?symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. but in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. symptoms can include:• fever• cough• trouble breathing • feeling tired• muscle achesmost people have mild symptoms. some people have no symptoms at all. but in other people, covid-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death.this is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.when should i see a doctor?if you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to covid-19, call 937 (the saudi moh service center) immediately.you might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days:• you lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has information about which areas are affected. this can be found on their website:  ncov/travelers/index.html• you had close contact with a person who has the virus – this generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.if your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. they can tell you what to do and where to go.if you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. the staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people.if you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead.this way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.how is covid-19 treated?most people with covid-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. if you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""icu"").there is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions;

the results of any antibody serology tests the cdc has conducted and a full breakdown of the real fatality rate, stratified for each cohort of age, gender, race, and health status. if they don’t have this data, then what is the purpose of throwing tens of billions at them?how many nursing home residents died, as distinct from those who died among the general population, along with a state-by-state breakdown.how many deaths occurred on the day they were recorded vs. how many were backfilled.how many of the nursing home deaths are confirmed as having died as a result of the virus, as opposed to just having tested positive (like tens of millions of americans who likely had the virus but didn’t get a severe case).how many coronavirus patients were admitted straight from hospitals to nursing homes, broken down by state.a definitive national and state-by-state number of how many of the 72,000+ deaths were in long-term senior care facilities.if we cant get this simple data published by the administration, why even give  another penny? why do we have to rely on private studies?	0

do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. can we ban the use of that happy lung clip art? 🥴 can we band travelers coming here from the hot spots	0

protect 2nd amend.  correlation is causation  terror will continue to reign as long as good men do nothing. obama has to be a plant to destroy america _boyle1  did they change the definition of mass shootings ? i'm sure this will be labeled workplace violence. i'd love a source on that. also, wasn't the awb during clinton and bush2?  are you trying to say it's reagan's fault? 😱  his legacy will be  alot of blood shed at home i am sure the hateful, divisive, us vs. them rhetoric from  wasn't a factor./sarc off obama = hate race religion gender himself?  just like the stock market does better with dem president fact, this is merely coincidental.  alleen de laatste doet er iets aan. dat is verschil en media duikt op alles!!  what is the appropriate response to sabotage?_50  lol. well...  maduro ? fidel ?  obama has encouraged mass shootings by politicizing them. also by being useless defending against terrorism. _texas if that is true, that is a crazy statistic  162 of these were work related violence.  enter in causalties of war. may even the playing fieldthis happens when congress blocks rational gun control. mass shootings boost gun sales &amp; nra lobbyists.    the entitlement of the right. have their beliefs and position questioned and they lose their shit. all a bunch of bs  162, most of which were in gun free zones!  the establishment of no gun zones created this disaster_c_meyer   maybe they aren't totally accurate. but we weren't having these kinds of convos pre-2008zlinks to democrats and a islam are rampant!    see the pattern dems. drive people to madness killers they are  because that evil, sick funk muslim potus likes it !  its hard not to give excuses to anyone, but social cohesion must be part of it. obama divides. nice visual!!  he's a muslim  and yet liberals continue to support our dick-tator in chief. this is not coincidental but orchestrated. _gate correlation =/= causation  how about the numbers in the workforce breakdown too??  ovamit's climate change - disarm america and let the terrorists rain bullets and bombs.  thank you for this, i was going to look this up. i knew it was much higher, but had no idea it was this high!!   it's still all the fault of pres. bush  out of curiosity, what's the source of those numbers?  wow! what variables are you comparing? statistics are pointless without meaning? p-value less than .05, i believe there's a significant difference.  the common denominator is obama when it comes to death in america when he is gone we can begin to rebuild usa♥  so it's obama's fault people are insane?  very interesting. a breakdown by race might explain some things.  i'm thinking poor real economy colliding with entitled kids + social media = an abundance of a**holes_cards   why the increase under o ? o &amp; his injustice dept. will not pursue death penalty for punishment of criminals _ what analysis _c_meyer   cause there wasn't much social media like there is today global warming has gotten worse. i'm sure that's why obama's number is so high. right? what would they do if we said we want to keep our guns to combat climatechange and the madness it's creating?  do not be deceived. there are 2 possible motives. 1) gun control 2) police state  obama is bad omen  a pertinent comment on the increased violence under an islamic-inclined president,   by the numbers islamist muslims kill obama faith deadlier then obama !   not surprising - those presidents had a gun control act which was struck down in 2008 tcotno, cultural rot &amp; o works to disarm law abiding citizens while making others soft targets!    hey i'm starting to see a trend there with those numbers. can you spell democrap? according to liberal math there's been 352 this year, so it's even worse if you add murdered feelings. liberallogic    more than an ""omen"" he is a puppet of evil - pure n' simple..  step it up, ronald  …… oops. the relevant number? gun homicides annually.  …. dropping steadily. _texas ok, but what are the golf handicaps of each president? only stats this idiot is interested in! i'm waiting to hear pres. obama spin the mass shooting stats [on his watch] as caused by climatechange. almost all after changes in expanded definition, and increase in more restrictive laws. thanks libs. i'll keep mine thanks.  boy this info is enlightening. the most divisive president in us history has quite a legacy with this stat.  is there a democrat problem?  _suis_liberte go back to your safe zone. we'll take care of everything. as usual.    seriously we have three guns and i don't. ammo is expensive.  wow it's interesting how global warming has driven islamic terrorists in america &amp; our president mad.  right on plan to destabilize the nation.  interesting since reagans time, the numbers have unfortunately increase, why?

"sunday psa, please read and share.what is herd immunity in ontario for covid? based on  calculations, about 2.1%  with only 1 in 11 cases of covid detected.only 2.1% of population has had exposure = no herd immunity and must be careful!!perhaps you think these calculations are theoretical and don't matter. but they align very well with what swiss researchers have found-- 11.6 cases for every 1 case detected. most of the population of geneva remains unexposed despite large case number. please--wash your hands, wear masks, keep as far away from others and limit interactions. all these actions will help to keep you, your family, your neighbours, and our healthcare system healthy!!so children are usually considered 'vectors of disease' and everyone believes that kids spread germs. but is this true for covid? could it be that kids are not the superspreaders we think they are?summary work from irish health technology group here.......and a link to the report they have published here 👇what's going on with younger kids? are they breathing less volume on people (yes, they are smaller)? talk less forcefully? do they have less prolonged interaction with others compared to older kids? or is there something fundamentally different in their immune response?well it looks like policies aimed at kids may have a lesser impact on transmission of coronavirus infections. implications for school openings. sick kids hospital in agreement.""kids are not the super-spreaders"""	0

"  under the ""how long is the incubation period for covid-19?"" section?  you do realise that it takes at least 2-3 weeks for any measures to make a difference right?  ok, another twitter expert it seems. have a word with the cmo, he’ll probably be well pleased with your input  aren't you the twitter expert? you clearly think that you know better than the science supporting the action of governments globally?  no. i observed that the measures italy have put in place havent seemed to have made a difference. i haven’t made any statements about how long measures take. you have.  ok well you should probably read this  then you may learn why they are having such issues in italy.  that’s virtually the same advice on the gov website. it’s just a q&amp;a. it doesn’t explain “why italy are having issues”  as i said incubation period is 1-14 days. italy has been locked down since the 9th march (13 days) there will be cases coming in since before that. people won't be in hospital from day 1 of symptoms. time delay is the killer here. by the time it's visibly bad it will be too late.  ah ok. and where can i find all that information on the link you gave me?  right ok, so if the measures in italy are successful then the death rate should be falling drastically over the next 2 days?  hopefully... although you would also need to know how long people are showing symptoms before they die. point is we can't wait and need to try everything we can to stop the spread. otherwise the nhs will be on its knees. italy has more hospital beds per capita than us."	0

"brain teaser: assume that 5% of the population has covid19 antibodies, and the serology test has a 95% accuracy (specificity=sensitivity=0.95). what is the probability p that i have antibodies if i test positive? (for bonus points explain your answer in comments) not needed to respond the teaser.  hence the answer is the ""tricky"" d) (which i did not get, because i wasn't watching for strict inequalities and thought i was picking ""greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95"") 0.5 if you are a frequentist. if you are an hypochondriac bayesian and you work in an hospital with covid-19 patients, i.e., p(antibodies) &gt; 0.05, then the probability shifts towards 1. if you apply bayes you get the same result. of course, things change if you change the prior, but that is unrelated to frequentist vs. bayesian. hint: thomas bayes would be of great help strict inequalities. prior and likelihood neutralize each other exactly p(covid=y)=0.05 p(test=y)=0.095 p(test=y|covid=y)=0.95 p(covid=y|test=y)= p(test=y|covid=y) p(covid=y) / p(test=y) ; 0.95 0.05 / 0.095 = 0.5 i'm taking my chance and not reading the other replies beforehand. it's 50/50! 😱 we have two random binary variables: tst (good test) and atb (antibodies present). plus one observable: res(ult). given same specificity and sensitivity, we can assume both vars are independent (?) thus, among four possible combinations of tst x atb, we have two that lead to res=positive, i.e., (tst and atb) or (not tst and not atb). p(tst,atb)=p(not tst,not atb)=0.0475. so, 50/50 between these two possibilities. 50%  400 person trial. 20 are positive. 380 negative. 361/380 of the negative test negative. 19/20 of the positive test positive.  but 19/380 negative test positive. any positive test is 50/50 a true positive or false negative. if i test positive i am either a fp or a tp. the number of fps is the number of negatives (95% of pop.) x the chance of misclassifying them (5%). the number of tps is the number of positives (5% of the pop.) x the chance of correctly classifying them (95%). hence, p=0.5. cheeky answer categories! i'm always entertained by how similar bayes' theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other. 50%  one of my first go-to questions while interviewing data science candidates true positives (tp): .95*5%false positives (fp): .05*95% =  tpp = tp/(tp+fp) = 50% but, here is the issue. i can say i have a magical prediction power. simply, i predict a negative result for everybody. and i win over the lab test.... but i have zero sensitivity! none of the above. it is 50% =50%. could use bayes, but ppl don't understand that so do example:   suppose 10k ppl tested.  at 5% incidence 500 have antibodies, 9500 don't.  .95*500 = 475 true positives.  0.05*9500 = 475 false negatives.  fn = tp so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0.5"	0

should i be worried that i’ve seen more and more people thinking “what if covid 19 is just like the flu?” even at 0.5% mortality, and with similar rates of infection as flu/cold, that’s 250k deaths + hospitals under stress i am someone who asked that question. just trying to find a way to make sense of it. is the difference the global scope? the mortality rate? the unknown unknowns! yes! but i’ve seen a couple of non epidemiologists sort of wondering if the epidemiologists are wrong. this is precisely when you feel the lack is both state and trust in science the most.	1

the kush tush swiper?   omg! rotflmbfao! priceless! 😂🙀😂🙀😂😷  is it safe to start alone time happy hour at 2pm if i wear a mask and wash my hands?   yes  can covid -19 be transmitted through trump's thin skin?  i do not want to know the answer to the icing question.  let’s not really destroy my happiness.  😂  three tubs is perfectly normal right? asking for a friend.  13.5g of sugar per pound of body weight is lethal to humans. that’s about 5lbs of sugar...or 8.5lbs of frosting. ld50  hey stephen, wifey miss you running across the screen at the beginning of the show... can you run across with fun &amp; excitement... i know it’s a small corner... lol... chase your kid around the camera kmsl ....  there is also invermectin used for parasites that’s giving good results!  how long can someone be a carrier of coronavirus after contracting it?  how about ""how do we get rudy giuliani the medical attention he needs?""  will the cdc issue guidelines for the disease that is in the white house?  i feel like, at this point, i need the answer to the second question more.  “china has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. the united states greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. it will all work out well. in particular, on behalf of the american people, i want to thank president xi!”- *p. trump  jan 24  i love you stephen you're so funny and keeps it real.  can u add cheez wiz to that last question?  i miss the studio audience, too. have you considered trying a zoom virtual audience? i could never see your show live, so i would love the opportunity to be a part of your zoom audience!  stephen you look great at home!  geez. i could have used the *frosting quota* info dayssss is ago...  can you combine that with how many sugar cookies its medically safe to eat in one sitting as well?  wouldn’t that depend on the flavor?frosting, that is. not the covid-19.  can’t wait for my souvenir signature from trump i am fine with him holding up millions of needed checks just so he can have his name on it.  yes, the frosting.  if you had kimmel, corden, &amp; fallon as guests on separate nights, and they each in turn had the other three as guests on separate nights, and so on, and so on...  at what point would you get to piers morgan?  because that’s when i’m done!     i really need the frosting question. asking for a friend.  too much frosting gave me a migraine and i puked 😬  well now i'm in the mood to eat a sheet cake, tina fey-style.  so how much frosting can u eat in one sitting😳🤷‍♂️😝 asking for a friend..😇😜   just watched last night’s on utube. yer getting the hang of it. better this week  thank you for asking the important questions stephen.  my favourite ""can 5g cause coronavirus?"" this was a genuine question from a journalist.  steven, where are our tax dollars going if the president isn’t taking this pandemic serious and is only focused on opening the government?  stephen, we love you and lssc, but the from home thing is just not working for us. it's cool. we'll be back when you are. thanks for the effort.  i know it was deleted and reposted without the typo, but:""what are they, symptoms of covid-19?""   congratultion  excellent monologue! 😅  also how much toast is ok to eat in a day. can you restart the count by changing the topping?  all the frosting is my recommendation.  pawesome openimg! very funny. had just finished watching _homeland &amp; was still on edge of my seat. u r very zen 2night. suited my mood.pls invite  on yr show.i “discovered” her yesterday, as did the usa!pls keep doin’ what u r doin’—giving us much-needed solace😷  i made a trump cake, is there too much frosting?   now, i want frosting..., i thought i'd be a bad influence.  please don't hug anyone,  ugh 🤮  great show.  are drive-thrus safe?  sorry i can’t look at dr. lapook without thinking of the great leslie nielsen...   will there be a second wave?  the advice given from this drlapook is too much for a normal person... sorry not going to wash my takeout food wrappers 😖  who picks up the bags he leaves in the hallway?  is it safe to watch  press conferences?  i think i had this in december...or a strain of it and i had already gotten flu shot and pneumonia shot as well  maybe next time.. 😞  thanks.. now you made the diabetic want some frosting😂  i found it unsettling that while talking to dr. lapook you took another alcohol drink in the middle of his explanation of potential life saving drugs!  this was disrespectful and inappropriate. do you have some drinking problem where you must drink while broadcasting your show?  fever, dry cough, a whole pint container as long as it’s the whipped kind.  nutella instead. 😀  ask him why i am starting to resemble my sourdough starter.  great show tonight. great guest!  thank you  some body said we have to wash our hands for 15 minutes? is it right?  youtube not showing notifications for ur videos 😞  i’m just going to assume the answer to the frosting one is “three or four tubs”. thank you   if you eat the frosting while standing, it is exercise. trembling with fear burns calories.  tuesday night was hilarious!  your team is doing great job producing an entertaining show on the fly.  sort of like replacing an airplane engine in flight.  i miss the live audience  a. craving sweetsb. the whole thingyou’re welcome  why was dr. lapook evasive in so many of his answers? example: ""when can we hug again?"". answer: ""hugging is good for you.""  if viewers want evasion, we get that with trump's press conferences. how about a good honest, ""i don't know.""? unless this was satire it was wastedtime  highlight of my week: i shave on wednesdays. what's your highlight?  bothered  me he said the drug  trump  was pushing like a dealer with no scientific proof and  condemned by  the  ama this dr said  was part of the standard  protocol  in treating  patients  maybe  this is a new york  thing i as a patient  would like  the right  to refuse it  very good questions about covid19.  thank you for bringing drlapook to your program.  i am getting tired of cooking but i have been afraid of ordering.  now i feel a little more confident about deliveries.  in a graham cracker i would like to say as much as it takes...and don’t forget the tall glass of milk!  you should interview john krasinski! he has this amazing show called some good news and i think he would be a great person to interview.  thanks for doing your show.  i hope you can feel our laughter across the airwaves.  ❤️  i was able to watch sam hunt and dave matthews in my chair.  g.i. jon has done so well that i couldn't think of anything to ask him.  he couldn't be betta'.  i have a question for dr. lapook. why are they serving the ""trump cocktail"" to covoid patients at his hospital?  can't wait to hear about the frosting thing!  it's for a friend...  i am on plaquenil for ra. am i immune?  you might ask the doc how to fix this. 😁    dr. my husband snores can i get the corona virus if he breathes on me?  thank you from canada for letting the world know how  is the worst  in history! keep up your good work stephen!  as much homemade buttercream frosting you can stomach before vomiting. (x-nay on canned) symptoms- many cough, fever, body aches, out of breath or none of the above. cannot really know without a test. everyone needs to be tested.  dear doctor, would it make stephen and some first responders happier if he would invite them to zoom/skype in to be his audience? he could hear their responses and they would get a sweet preview of the show! win/win?  great interview!  you may find this interesting...  more importantly, what was  looking at up and to his right...over and over during that interview?a clock?another samurai sword?espn highlights of the 11/10/99 game vs. the rockets where he and barkley got ejected? 😉loveyashaq  would love to see john and the band do a song on zoom, miss seeing the whole band!!!  stephen, thank you for the laughs each night. you are one of the few bright lights these days.  enjoying a late show! really like the ""home show""! and can hear and enjoy the musicians so much better! cbs is doing a great job to keep this all going forward!  these are important things to find out.  on your show you've mentioned you miss the audience; would it help at all if your viewers recorded their reactions, sent them in, were complied together in 1 file then played over the show taping?  i mean, i know it wouldn't help during recording since it's not live. but, at least, you'd know how people reacted (maybe).🙂💕  i can confirm from personal testing the answer to the second question is “more than 1 jar” aaand now i want to instacart a frosting. natesfault  after just a few weeks our skies are clearer and the water is cleaner. maybe we could plan to return to a different and better normal. betternormal   and there are dolphins swimming in the canals in venice. that one really impressed me. (and i saw the pictures).  😂😂 watching you change into pajamas for cate blanchett was hilarious!! i love it when you have her as a guest. she is soooooo intelligent and funny. what a great pajama party!! 🤣  here.. you might need this.   time you have steve martin redo his king tut song. born in a penthouse, moved to the whitehouse, king trump...  hey stephen you're great ask the doc about cures are the symptoms  or  my phone is running out of geodatum and some guys tried to trip me in the woods near 711 looking for walsh so i might not be able to tweet your site. hug. can i have another?  i have an answer regarding frosting.  eat as much as you want as long as it’s not fake frosting, like the imposter, whipped cream.  it’s the cake you really have to be careful of.  in fact, i only eat the icing, buttercream, of course.  you are my mental medicine for this social distancing. i love seeing you. don’t stop.  can we please start asking more hard pressing questions. keep this up and the number of peabody awards  gets will only be increasing.  excellent, both people that tuned in were probably thrilled.  peanut butter by the spoonful, what's the harm?  icing. as much as you want until you barf. just make sure the barfing is from the icing and not the daily presidential briefing. oops, meant presidential rally. if determined from the briefing, keep icing.  who’s the last person you shook hands with?  giuliani.  he lied too  is it ethical to ""try a mix"" of cocktail drugs on people?  how come donald trump refuses to wear a mask?  is it true that gloves are immediately trash the second you touch something?  should you ever take hydrochloroquine for coronavirus?  wow, dr. lapook was great, thank you for being so informative to us poor saps quarantined at home scared sh-tless of this virus  ""how much frosting is it medically safe to eat in one sitting?""the 'it' is redundant.irksome sentence, come on, your english is better than that.  can you give the donald trump bashing a rest it’s getting so dam old now  are you rivers cuomo? he's cute too either way. i went to a weezer concert in tampa but he looked short. i didn't go to the one at fsu that was free. i was a law student also.  keep your clothes on stevo  can we give  hydroxychloroquine?

 no one has talked about building the immune system with what you eat and taking supplements.  this can help mitigate the symptoms is to build a strong immune system.  all i hear is drugs and vaccine. guess there is no money in foods and supplements.  whos a bigger pedophile... stephen colbert or steven spielberg?

how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). the most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease covid-19.what is covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.symptoms the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if theyeyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?”	0

occupies several seats within this omt. what is the scientific foundation of the omt advice and what is the reason this ‘herd immunity’ like strategy was adopted?government deems the chosen strategy a success, or more specifically, that is the message the government tries to convey to the public. the government claims to have based their decision on sound scientific advice provided by the omt. the dutch centre for disease control (rivm)..technical briefing march 18th an important key in resolving these questions was provided in the parliamentary technical briefing of march 18th 2020. in this briefing omt chairman ...jaap van dissel presented the following (figure 1) that outlined the strategic options that were considered by the omt.figure 1, the 3 conceived covid-19 pandemic control strategies the three considered strategic options:1. no interventions, a worst-case scenario, where the virus is allowed to spread freely (red);2. maximum control, a mitigation scenario, where social distancing decelerates the spread (green);3. lock-down, a containment scenario, where..mandatory isolation diminishes the spread (blue);had been evaluated using a model, for which to date no source code or parameters were made public. the lock-down scenario is kind of odd, it would have been expected that the post-maximum slope of this curve would be ...significantly steeper as compared to ‘no interventions’ curve. surprisingly, here the slope is even shallower than the ‘maximum control’ slope. this suggests there is a feedback present, which decelerates the spread, in the model used to evaluate these strategic options. simplified epidemic modellingepidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease, a one-way transfer is considered, where persons transfer from one bin to the next. the rate at which persons transfer is described by ...a parameter. an example is the seir model this model considers four disease stages:1. susceptible: persons that are susceptible to the pathogen, i.e., not immune;2. exposed: persons that are exposed to the pathogen, but or not yet contagious;3. infected: persons that can spread the pathogen;4. recovered: persons that have recovered, i.e., immune;figure 2, seir model containing four disease stages. the transfer rates govern how long a person remains in a specific disease stage, e.g., the duration of the infectious period is determined by parameters %delta and %gamma. such a disease model does not directly consider adverse effects a disease may have, ...e.g., disability to death. the previously noted feedback present in the model results presented at the technical briefing, suggests there is a parallel route (figure 3) within the model used for... figure 3, a parallel seir with a severe and asymptomatic  route. scenario discrimination. such a parallel route, if it runs via asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, could provide for a path to recovered and therefore immune persons. the other route is comprised of symptomatic persons, which may require additional care. if the ...symptomatic persons are in their ‘infectious bin’ for a longer duration, as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly, i.e., a huge dampening effect. as the pathway through ...asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic dominates over symptomatic persons.this parallel seir model, when applied to the covid-19 data available from wuhan (narrow spike), would yield the following conclusions about the virus:1. was highly infectious (most infected people where not on the radar in wuhan);2. could not easily be contained.figure 4, idealised seir-tti model. unfortunately, the parallel seir model is in a sense equivalent to a seir model that allows for track-trace-isolation (tti) shown in figure 4. ironically, that is what the chinese actually did, they aggressively tracked, traced, and isolated infected and suspected persons. ...this essentially halts transmission, the ‘exposed bin’ is kept (nearly) empty.when the seir-tti model is applied to the wuhan data this would yield the following conclusions about the virus:1. was moderately infectious;2. tti was very effective.the suspected actual used model is more involved, as it is comprised of several age levels, e.g., for each age cohort a more detailed seir-tti equation is applied. when age separation is considered it may have appeared, based on wuhan data that herd immunity could be build ...relatively cheaply and quickly by keeping younger people at work (as the r0 would be hugely overestimated, while the severity of the disease was hugely underestimated), while vulnerable people kept home. a costly mistake as it has turned out.for more details and references see (in dutch): 	0

what is a coronavirus?coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers, sars and now, covid-19.what are the symptoms of covid-19?the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 1/3some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

so another important data point to review each day is the percent positive of all patients tested, by pcr and serology test types. what is “percent positive”? out of the total number of missourians tested, it is the percentage that have had a positive test result.for june 1, that percentage was 6.5% for pcr tests and 4% for serology tests. you can also find a table showing how many tests were done each day in missouri, and how many of those were positive. if you view that table, you will note that the number of positive tests daily has remained relatively stable, while the total number of tests daily has increased.that means the percentage of missourians being diagnosed with covid-19 is lowering.to view this information to help understand the full picture, visit  and select covd-19 dashboard. if you are viewing on a mobile device, select “mobile site” in the yellow box at the top left for improved accessibility of the information.or you can click on the circle in the top left of each individual box to view the information full screen. for best viewing, use a desktop or laptop.covid19 | showmestrong	0

why are schools closing for a virus i literally do not get it...covid-19 is just like the flu why are we flipping tables and setting fires for a virus that’s gonna spread whether we can control it or not?? honestly i am wondering the same thing??? and like it is stressing me out that all these places are closing for what it’s blown wayyyy out of proportion, i get trying to protect those who aren’t able to fight off a virus like it but the rest of us will be fine it’s so ridiculous🙄 i 100% get that!! but when you think about the flu or other viruses that are close or just as likely of killing someone with a suppressed immune system why weren’t we freaking out about that? idk it just seems so blown out of proportion :/ to attempt to keep it from becoming like it is in italy rignt now. hospitals are overwhelmed there. even though only 20% of the cases are hospitalized it’s still like 20 admissions per day. they had 300 cases just a week ago. it’s not super deadly but super contagious i think instead of closing they should just let people who are not healthy, old, immunocompromised, etc, leave and stay home from things without consequences. it seems much easier to do that than close everything for everyone it is being blown out of proportion. i think because there is no approved vaccine yet and it is seeming to spread pretty rapidly so it’s easier for panic to ensue.	1

 who: “can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?“studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.”among the unknowns re covid-19: how airborne is it? not very much. thought to be “spray” if through the air not floating around the same way influenza does. most common route is thought to be touching things then your face. it can be detected in aerosols three hours later, according to a preprint. so that’s a concern.  bottom line: yes it’s possible to contract covid-19 from the air, but that’s not the main concern.my coworker’s mother has been hospitalized for six weeks in wuhan. her caregiver (husband) didn’t contract it despite sharing air.	0

 that's what i dont understand. if nyc is saying 25% of people have had it (or whatever), what is stopping the other 75% getting it (or at least 35% before you get herd immunity) &amp; dying at a rate of c0.7%? there is zero logic to it, unless you believe the serology number is wrongfyi those engaging with my tweet re nz: i am very convinced by prof michael levitt’s logic in this interview- it’s a must watch.   key takeaways: covid infections are never exponential and infection rates start to slow quite quickly after a proportion of the population become infected. this suggests very strongly that immunity is being conferred. mmm - feels like he is betting the farm on the fact there will be no second wave. if he's wrong, it's absolutely horrible. well, the pattern of each local epidemic since the first 2 in china, on to south korea, iran and italy have all been very similar. i think it’s very safe to assume that a population which has had that level of exposure of a london or new york won’t have a “second wave” nothing. did you listen to the whole interview? the slightly unpalatable truth is that there is a minimum level of infection and death needed to confer immunity in a population. he quantifies it as 4 weeks of “excess deaths” here he was on march 30 telling us new york had turned the corner. 	0

  that’s pretty close to herd immunity, which is about 60%. ifr here is about 0.3%, which is typical, so tough mountain spirit only goes so far. what is average age?austrian ski resort ischgl was one of the epicenters of sarscov2:- 1,473 tested (79% of population) in late april- 42.4% have antibodies- 6x higher than pcr tests- 85% asymptomatic- 9 hospitalizations, 2 deaths  yes, although the article notes that 42.4% is still quite some way from herd immunity. also, it hilariously mentions that the low rate of hospitalizations is due to the tough mountain spirit.   yes, ifr of 0.26%.none of the newspaper articles link to the study so i can't see for myself, but tested subjects were:- 1,259 adults- 214 children (&lt;18)- 479 householdsinterestingly, only 27% of tested children have antibodies (42.4% overall).  it seems like they only communicated the study results via press conference so far: 	0

the fear cant hurt you, not even when you are sick with covid-19.....so what is covid-19 gonna do? make me scared of dying and turning to my last resort which is god anyway. cmon why wait til the last minute and destroy the weapon of the devil which is fear.but i will live on...where will you spend your eternity existing, in a free and wonderful place...or in hell by believing the lies that its really the best place. hell is contrary to heaven. if hell is fire and brimstone, weeping, wailing, gnarling and gnashing of teethand a worm that eats you but never dies... like the maggots that feed off of rotting flesh....i wont be afraid of no covid-19, nor a heart attack, nor suffering, nor death as tho its a suffering.  i wont even fear my anxiety from my own brain disorder. the only one i revearthat i fear in reverence is the lord our god.  because even the devil cant destroy a soul and body...but only a body...whats a body..this spirit is willing, and god willing so is the flesh. because fear is a prison. keeping us locked up, broke, an suffering cabin fever..fear harms the soul by keeping you busy from god to be greatful, and worship him rain or sunshine....worship him the creator of your spirit, which is your existance.  without him your soul will suffer. or in otherwords covid-19 fear without realizing that there are more survivorsthan there are deaths.  look at all of you that are panicing and are puppets to the fear.and have a relationship with god.4fear of the unknown breeds hatred and kills or causes sin basically because you turn from god who is love, and has plans for every christian, not to harm you, but prosper you, to give you a hope and a future. amen	0

  _law do you think the 350m are ready to accept a ubi? if the ubi is able to purchase basic food and housing, why do we need it? why not remove money entirely? at what level of the collectives should a ubi be established? (note: i have not said whether i am for or against a ubi.)  western people are somewhat confined to thinking about individuals instead of the systems that they are a part of, create, and sustain.sorry to be an ass about it, but if you don't understand this, you won't understand anything i say   i actually just watched that video fairly recently, at _law request. 💜to solve these sorts of problems, we definitely need systems thinking. i'm reasonably educated in this area.also spent many years working in semiconductor, on spc &amp; supply chain infrastructure.  _law i can see what you’re saying. thank you. i think part of the issue is that i don’t think in hierarchies or boundaries. why does “systems thinking” tend to go bigger instead of smaller?person = rose (for now)pedals = mindstem = bodyto be continued. :)  _law what about:washington state = rosepedals = citizen (person)stem = government (people)united states = rose…north america = rose…world = roseeach pedal has its own needs (notice they don’t all fall at once). to your point, there is a supply chain…at every scale.  _law the original principle still applies. some of the roses (for you) or pedals, or cells will be able to adapt - others won’t - trying to make reactions go faster though, tends to result in a smaller yield, i think.  _law almost all rose bushes can recover from mites, mold, and other vermin if they are properly fed and watered. their survivability is not an innate trait but an effect of the relationship with their environment/context.  _law what's failing is the system that arranged these 350 million this way (see: djia collapse, international travel rates and lockdowns, etc ).if we implement ubi so the 350m can buy their food reliably for 12 months, life will be peachy, but the oligarchy and corporatocracy won't  _law accept is a mental statewe need it because the current system of distribution (fed loans to commercial loans to payrolls) is pretty much at a standstill and restarting will take a decade.each heartbeat gets a ubi  _law reminds me of the fiona apple line: he said, “it’s all in your head.” i said, “so’s everything but he didn’t get it.” (state change = adaptation.)okay. let’s see how it goes over time. would be interested in seeing how this group of humanity adapts to that.	0

 possibly;  but one has to ask oneself what is different now from before.  the virus is no different.  large scale surveys tell us that not all that many in eg spain have had it [7%?] so herd immunity very unlikely.  maybe private social distancing is enough. climate?  unlikely.this article intrigued me.    so, unless i have missed reading something important, the early release of lockdown is precisely what is going to put us into the worst of both worlds.on the assumption that regulated social distancing has added to the economic cost paid up front, in that what we saw would not have happened with purely private social distancing...  if we release now without enough test trace isolate [sorry, very boring to continue to repeat]......then we'll have created a &gt; recession than needed for little gain, as we go back to a let the virus rip strategy.  what gain there will have been will have been purely about trimming the top off the 'curve' [ie reducing peak case load] and reducing mortality from lack of care. seems like a second wave is modestly unlikely... europe has returned without itsome us states have seen 'second wave' but really this is just first wave not properly reduced major unknown factor for me in this is prior immunity from previous coronavirus exposurei can't make the evidence and theory fit otherwise, and proper epidemiologists like  don't rule this out  what have you read on that last point?	0
q: can eating garlic help prevent infection with 2019ncov?a: garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from 2019-ncovknowthefacts  it could help prevent infection unless everybody eats it, in which case any benefit will be lost.	0

9. sars-cov-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldall coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.thread about some popular myths on corona virus1. spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyapplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. disinfect surfaces not skinthese cannot kill viruses within the body!!2. older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risksars-cov-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. however, anyone with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.6. cats and dogs spread coronaviruscurrently, very little evidence. however, in hong kong, a pomeranian whose owner had covid-19 became infected. the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus7. face masks protect against coronavirusdisposable face masks may not provide protection. yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. thus viral particles can also enter.8. hand dryers kill coronavirushand dryers dont kill. only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself9-2. thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans.10. antibiotics kill coronavirusantibiotics only kill bacteria and not  viruses.14. thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusthermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonscovid-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.15.  flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid-19as sars-cov-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.so please dont panic, follow the govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. finally dont forget to pray. shambho mahadeva🙏      _kala59  _jr _ir _tinku 	1

"  guarda la sezione ""what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?"" nelle faq per il pubblico e vedi tutti i suggerimenti che danno alle persone per ridurre al minimo il contagio  sì ho risposto in modo analogo anche io e concordo, ed è proprio posta male la domanda. cmq è ulteriormente complesso perchè nn è banale nemmeno dire che il consensus sia ""la vera scienza"".  la domanda secondo me è assolutamente legittima. non è che è posta male, ma indica davvero il dubbio che attanaglia molti. ""a chi devo fare riferimento?"", ""di chi mi devo fidare"", sono domande che si vedono molto spesso.  la comunità scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi è ciò che va' preso per riferimento, non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalità. a prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza.  ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia. burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da 2 mesi. ""state a casa"" nn è un claim scientifico. e' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita. non è scienza /  scienza è dire ""se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce"". il ""quindi state a casa a qualunque costo"" non è scienza.  no. l'oms ha detto che stare a casa è il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi. non probabilmente. lo hanno affermato con certezza. ed è confermato dai numeri. non lo dice burioni, né nessun altro. lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanità.  cmq no, è scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa è uccidere tutti gli esseri umani. se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani. partendo da lì, possiamo capire come il dire cosa ""minimizza"" nn serve mai a nulla.  quindi secondo te l'oms dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage? a che pro, se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chissà quanta gente è contagiata?  se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio è l'isolamento sociale, se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione.  definisci ""migliore"". nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna, e invece quello dovrebbero fare. poi politica sceglie con loro zitti mentre si sceglie.  la politica anche è responsabile della ""intromissione"" degli scienziati, eh. se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico, te ne stai lavando le mani.  ancora, nn cogli cosa intendo. loro devono dire ""chiusura fabbrica impatta x su tassi di contagio"". poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no, dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi, economici e sociali, dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori."	0

   _maxwell_ what is herd immunity? herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely.will you keep wearing masks and limiting your trips out until there is a vaccine widely available?_maxwell_ yep. viruses don't disappear. just look at measles. controlled, literally no cases in western world until anti-vaxers. measles are making a come back. virus didn't disappear, just waited for stupid people to not vaccinate. _maxwell_ if vaccines work for the vaccinated, why does it matter if others choose to not vaccinate? if you're vaccines do not work then why bother with them at all?  _maxwell_ seriously?  no medical knowledge at all, eh?  what about those who can’t get vaccinated?  what about those who choose not to?  we eradicated diseases until people got complacent.  _maxwell_ plenty of medical knowledge here. i have reversed more medical conditions than most because i choose to be healthy. i make healthy choices. if you do not want to succumb to viruses help those who are sick get healthy. contrary to popular belief it can be done.   _maxwell_ do some research in 2017 59 million people died worldwide. if you are conceived it is only natural that you will eventually die. no one is guaranteed one minute five years 30 years or a hundred years. that is life. the strong will survive. so be strong.	0

can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.there are lots of other reasons for good hygiene around pets, though. some common bacteria can pass between animals and people, such as e.coli and salmonella. washing your hands with soap and water can guard against them.who is most at risk?in the 2002-2003 sars outbreak, 8,422 people were infected and there were 916 deaths worldwide. the overall death rate for infected people was 11%. but for infected people 24 and younger, the death rate was just 1%, while for those aged 65+ it was 55%.in short, anyone can catch a virus. but the effect it will have on you, and how seriously ill you might become, can be dependent on several other factors.older people and anyone with pre-existing medical conditions, like asthma, diabetes or heart disease, appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the new coronavirus, according to the who.there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.can gargling mouthwash protect you from infection with the new coronavirus? no. there is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.some brands or mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth. however, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-ncov infection.the world health organization recommends taking the following precautions:1. frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water2. when coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands3. avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough4. if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your healthcare provider5. when visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals6. the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.	0

".:  muslim comment ""disqualifies"" him from presidency      ain't this whole thing gonna take a change when  backs someone.   that's a joke. obama should be disqualified for lack of leadership!   incredibly hilarious how they think this is law - white house does not 'decide' anything of the sort.    does supporting terrorist sponsor erdogan disqualify anyone from holding office in the us power structure?   big deal, trump leads and it keeps getting larger the more people talk.   trump controls the media,    josh, your boss is out of touch with world and u.s. reality, resonating now, as does the peanuts teacher.     i don't believe that is your decision to make   a scare tactic? he's the only&amp; best hope to restore our country. which will take more than 4yrs   congratulations! usa he got exposed too early!   cnn stop reporting using 10 seconds, you should report full and complete story unbiased!vote for trump.   who the fuck are you? trump is protected by free speach! did you write the president rule book?   he is a racist very dangerous   مرحب   _vargaz   well spoken but the republican party would not take note   i think thats up to the voters to decide that  , not cnn.      trump's words do not disqualify him! i don't see cnn or other liberals trying to remove obama or dq hillary   i would have thought his idiocy would have disqualified him first.   we live in hope u correct.       why is press secretary josh earnest lying about potus eligibilty?     it means he can't fulfill the oath. it's not formal/enforceable, (1/2)   the comments of the hmfic through un-earnest have absolutely no merit.    really rich coming from josh earnest.  btw, does us constitution apply to ppl in foreign lands?   so you want americans to only have an option between hillary or bernie. very liberal tactic.  trump supporter ... nuff said  😂   riiiight   who says he wants to be president in the first place?   سري جدا :يتحرش بضيفته على المباشر  شاهد!!!:o   the republican party doesn't have my permission to broker my vote. my person drops i decide who gets it.   трамп честно говорит то, о чём думает каждый, но боится признаться. трамп - один честный политик в сша.   lolol...don't always agree with mr. trump, but appears more qualified than mr.o.  at least he thinks.  honest question: aren't their any official restrictions that legally(!) disqualify a candidate who acts unconstitutionally?   josh is as misinformed here as obama is about gun control. constitution applies only to us citizens.    why did y'all lie    allowing muslims who support sharia in the united states disqualifies obozo   if any one impose ban entering any country of world on muslims or even talking abt will be brutally 💥💀👿🔫💣🔨🔪   why on earth the white house want to change its colours? white is fine!   but yet  under federal investigation does not disqualify her? gtfoh"	1

q. can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?a. studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  coronavirus coronovirusindiaq. what is a coronavirus?a: coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. coronavirus coronavirusindiaq. what is covid-19?a. covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.q. what are the symptoms of covid-19?a. the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. coronavirusq. how fatal is covid-19?a.

"what am i trying to say? everybody has their lane. that a particular trade is booming for someone you know does not mean it will boom for you. you do not know what they know. forget the glamorous results you see, people's secret efforts settles most of these things outwardly.many times you see many people post their achievements and accolades on social media and you say to yourself 'why not me?' when will it be my own turn? do they have two heads? etc. no! nothing is wrong with you. just discover your own lane and press forward. you are you!!!most people will not even write about their failures. i am super proud of my failures. i failed forward. my failures gave me more lessons and earned me the right and boldness to teach other people about business.your failures are a plus. you learn never to do things that same way. reason i embraced the lean approach. i learnt how to start a business with a very little cost, validate and then grow it.  () is a clear example. i will tell the story some dayby god's grace (all glory to god), doing my entrepreneurship career has gotten me recognition home and abroad including from president obama through his foundation, the dutch government, the wharton school, ventures platform, embassy of ireland in nigeria...others are regional universities forum for capacity building in agriculture (ruforum) - a network of 121 vice chancellors of african universities, federal government of nigeria, niger delta development commission (nddc)...small and medium enterprises development agency of nigeria (smedan), embassy of france in nigeria, bank of industry, african entrepreneurship awards, morocco, and several others.because of my work as an entrepreneur, i have had free, and i mean completely free trips to some countries in africa and europe. it looks like i am bragging but i am actually not.there were times i applied for these things - put myself forward, pushed and pushed and i always got a no! for me to share one award, recognition or free travel that came my way, i may have gotten nos in a multiple of 10, if not 20.there is a particular annual fellowship i have applied for every year from inception back to back for 6 times in 6 years. i will try again the 7th time this year and look forward to being selected. that is how it is.you have to develop a thick skin to getting nos, see them as part of the process and forge ahead. you have to learn from your mistakes and pick up yourself quickly. you have to ultimately look for your own lane and run your race.do not let anyone guilt trip you in believing that this life is a competition. we are not wired to do the same things. you also have to stay humble. little accolades should not get to your head. if it does, your dreams are so small. increase the elasticity.i moved to another city and drowned myself in bishop david oyedepo's book - understanding divine direction. i tried applying for jobs during this period and never did i get one. see, i have a very great cv, good schools, excellent grades and awesome work experience.as at that time, i had worked for an impact accelerator and consulting firm in nairobi, did a three year stint in two large commercial banks with several volunteering experiences.the first test invite i got, i passed and was asked to stay back for an interview same day. i was equally successful and was called to see the ceo which was the last stage of the recruitment process. maybe my price scared them, i was not called back as promised.the second one i ever got much later, i argued with my interviewer who felt he knew everything. lol. i didn't get both jobs. thank god. i am sure god was looking at me and shaking his head like ""see this boy i gave a master-plan trying to run the race of someone else"".discover your own lane and that is where you will shine effortlessly. this does not in anyway downplay the part of hard work. you will work extra hard and even harder as you go up. succeeding is easy. staying successful is not.that does not mean you will not celebrate your wins. celebrate them. enjoy them. but you know what, move on quickly and do the same things you were doing even more.i have my story! you have yours! they are never the same even though our results might be similar. it could even bring us plenty money and fame. but it is never the same.finally, success is not even about the money and the fame alone. it is about living your life in a way that you feel happy and fulfilled. only that, money makes the happiness and fulfillment sweeter. just find your lane, stay there and run your race. dazzol.blessed weekend."	0

"   what is the appropriate case fatality rate then?  1.4% is reasonable.   what percentage do you think is required for herd immunity?  even at 70%, the number dead is too high to contemplate w/o a vaccine: 3,2340,000.   herd immunity will arrive long before a vaccine.  that would require 70-80% of the population to be exposed. and our healthcare infrastructure is certainly not prepared to deal with the consequences of that.   and i doubt most of us are ready for the rate of death that would accompany that rate of exposure (3.7 million dead assuming a 1.4% death rate and 80% of us population exposed  [330 million x 80% x 1.4%] exposure)(is my math right?).   1.4% is wrong.  furthermore, you will not need an 80 percent infection rate to achieve this.

_eckart  agree. also 'herd mentality' based on history can be deadly. someone emailed   (conspiracy theories)big problem: average folks fail to ask questions/think critically. ie: what is a coronavirus? or look for data: ie: average number of flu deaths by age etc.coronavirus will change how we shop, travel and work for yearsde-globalization the main topic for the next decade?economies during this cycle have seen the largest interconnectedness ever. how would that change investors behaviours, perceptions?  the correlation between per-capita gdp and health (life expectancy) is essentially perfect. if the covid-19 pandemic leads to a global economy collapse, many more lives will be lost than covid-19 would ever be able to claim.  _eckart  oops! 	0

can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.let´s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. let´s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. so here´s a thread of q&amp;a on coronaviruses (covid-19) from world health organization.covidfreeaprilcovidfreephilippinescovidfreeworldsome people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

what is a coronavirus? coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to mers &amp; sars.the most recently discovered coronavirus is covid-19.i've read a lot about corona virus lately and i think i should share some highlights of the good read.it's a thread, and in form of q &amp; a.what is covid-19? covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms.older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.how does covid-19 spread? people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.how likely am i to catch covid-19? the risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a covid-19 outbreak unfolding there.should i worry about covid-19? although illness due to covid-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. it is still quite normal for people to worry about how the covid-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019.however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19.the mask can only be used once.if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:1. smoking2. taking traditional herbal remedies 3. wearing multiple masks 4. taking self-medication such as antibiotics.in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreakthread	0

my grandmother watches fox so she thinks the covid-19 is “just like the flu.” it’s 34x more deadly, 148x more deadly to people her age. trump is waging a disinformation campaign instead of protecting the us. it’s infuriating. what a shame. it’s a shame for the people who will die or be affected by the economic fallout. i am lucky that my mama is right along with me, she gets it. she is frail, and i worry so much, but she is dug in, and is being vigilant. i reckon i can be grateful for that. have you asked her about the covfefe-45 virus? he's so stupid he's trying to kill his own (aptly-named) base. i keep thinking that.	1

anyone else in a hotspot, wondering if even takeout food is safe? i used to think it was but i’ve seen too many stories on twitter of people that were super careful, somehow got covid &amp; they have no idea how. and if takeout isn’t safe, then isn’t grocery delivery also unsafe? 😔_az i lived through the hotspot in rockingham co nh.  worked in the hospital all that time and did quite a bit of curbside pickup for our favorite restaurants and had no problems.even though we’ve cooled down here, i’m still not eating in restaurants. eating in an actual restaurant isn’t even on my long range radar. i think we’re in this hell for a long time to come. i’m honestly feeling like we have a whole year ahead of us._az most evidence is that food is fine. i did do takeout even during the worst of it here. that’s what i thought too. but some credible stories of careful people not knowing how the hell they got covid is whacking me out. it’s confusing. i’m having a day.	0

_jasper_88 _rdc  is covid-19 airborne? i don’t think it is, but it would be good to confirm that. if it’s not, then contact is needed to contract it. if we take precautionary hygiene actions, it will help reduce it’s spread. i’d like incoming travel to stop temporarily. oz has natural quarantine._jasper_88 _rdc  twitter's newsfeed says australians are being told not to fly overseas, and the threat level is the highest in history.  true? _rdc  yes it's true, although i still can not understand why schools are going to be open._rdc _jasper_88  scomo? i think the facts support him though, very few cases of kids with it. they could be carriers without symptoms. _rdc  possibly, but what about the domino effect, example if one of them came near my mum she would die due to her health issues. the kids are more resilient but others are not. that's my thinking. _rdc  personally i am thinking it is, why else is it spreading like wildfire also it would have just been contained in wuhan.. i may be wrong but that's my view._jasper_88  _rdc yes!  it is airborne and much of the spreading is due to that. we're told to stay a minimum of 3 feet (~1 meter) from other people, and 6 feet is strongly recommended.  when you cough it easily travels 3 feet, 6 feet for a deep cough.  never touch your face.	0

should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19.the mask can only be used once.if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms.are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019.however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:1. smoking2. taking traditional herbal remedies 3. wearing multiple masks 4. taking self-medication such as antibiotics.in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreakthread	0

""5g mobile networks do not spread covid-19""this is a real myth buster infographic by the .in fact, it's the very first infographic that's listed under the section ""advice for public"". here's another one fighting against the myth that garlic prevents infection.  these myths might seem absurd to many of us.it's clear though that this kind of misinformation continues to circulate widely (and maybe not in the groups that we are a part of). as a healthcare community, we need to re-establish ourselves as the voices of reason. where this starts, however, is with independent and critical appraisal of the best available evidence by each and every one of us.the media (and that includes reputable sources) will continue to simplify and sensationalize scientific news.indiscriminate sharing of articles summarizing papers and posts with one-liners from abstracts only perpetuates and validates this.if we aren't reading the papers and pointing out flaws in internal and external validities, who will?and most importantly, if we aren't appraising and translating the evidence into something the public can understand, who will?we need to continue to support and strengthen the voices of those who take the time to provide balanced assessments through this unique time. shout out to   share some of your favorite voices with me."	0

in the race to stop the spread of covid-19, some are wondering if herdimmunity is the answer. but what is that exactly?here's what things look like now: for this to work, 70 percent of the population would need to have immunity. that's 229,767,666 people in the u.s. alone. scientists reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious covid-19 is specifically. this is called r0 value. it measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect. this is how covid-19's r0 values compare to other diseases. even though the numbers are high and it may seem simple at first glance, most scientists aren't onboard with relying on herdimmunity. why? this tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the u.s. and 30 million around the world. that's millions too many. until a vaccine can provide widespread immunity, communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable, especially heading into the fall, when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain. the alternative would be devastating.experts also noted that by social distancing, we can mimic this tactic. staying six feet away from others also prevents the virus from bouncing to a new person.interested in learning more about covid-19 and herdimmunity?  has more here⤵️here's what that looks like: 	0

假新闻真是张嘴就来，who官网上英文版也没说不让喝中药啊。 最后一条：is there anything i should not do?里面只说了不要抽烟、不要带多层口罩、不要自医。我也不信中医，但这和编假新闻是两回事。   之前有的，被删了. 你看法语版 法语版还真有，无效果操作的第二条：服用传统草药  估计2000万美元到账了就给删了👀 我们不禁要做这样的推测，有人发现微博或twitter上讨论中英版本的差异，中共赶紧告诉谭德塞，修改了英文版 昨晚还在，估计应中方要求删了……  天朝捐了款，所以删除 走规则代理3条，全局4条 昨天还有一条，明明写着草药无用，已经删了，可以找找早先截图 貌似在修改吧，我早上看到还有。  刚刚删。很多推看到有之前的截图 昨天我看到时特地去看了一下，英文确实是四条 正能量要400-2500,胡说八道得多少钱?1000起步吧。 我看还有啊 请求证后再发言 谢谢_mingyan  求证过了。现在法语西班牙语都还在。英语被修改了 英文改了刚，除了中英文看看其他语言版本亲  早上刚验证过是真新闻，和ip地址有关 现在的新闻真是真假难辨 给删了而已，有条件可以找历史编辑和历史快照记录自己看 我昨晚截了图，很多人也自己截了图，都是有的。 新闻要连着看，你看到的不一定是真的，有可能已经阉割。 昨天有，今天给删了。  你点开链接看了么？我的截图你看了么？ 你换成全局代理或者大陆白名单在访问看看？现在国内ip访问英文版没有，国外ip访问第二条还在。 人家假新聞？人家張嘴就來？而你呢？開口就噴？有點智商嗎？你自己對ccp的瞭解如同幼稚園小朋友一樣而已。 shame 昨天特意去看了，确实有。今天又没了。我觉得who可能也觉得这个自己证据不足吧。希望who如果有确实的实验数据，可以公示出来。 即便是此刻，你的截图都是错的，不吃传统草药的那条记录还在，请自查链接 我们打开为啥显示不一样呢？  你看晚了，已经修改了	0

"  sigh.  i'd like to see an official statement- specifically stating whether they bought photos, paid for trip, etc.  but he did get paid by his fund but speculation &amp; hysteria are the national passtime! i just wanna see you on  tomorrow. ;) okthanks for this clarificationmt  cnn producer i talked to said doubted they paid. cred got it // you mean it wasn't 's gentle rub and tug?. in fairness to , he reported brown ""was involved with"" 2nd degree murder. much more vague and irresponsible.  wait.  you act as if payment isn't a routine thing.  why?    no one can get financial aid for school with a criminal record!!!   just bloody wrong    we have blacks in the news that know how to investigate. let them do their job and report the truth.  is that where this thing i keep seeing in tweets that wilson is taken care of for life is coming from??: agreed. news, as you know, doesn't pay for interviews.  but there are other, more oblique ways subjects are compensated  yes...extensive emphasis on wilson...info on the physical evidence was ""hidden"" in the coverage...hard to find. wilson said he wasn't paid.     abc won't make a definitive public statement though. why?  my understanding was that abc said they don't pay for interviews, not that they didn't compensate wilson somehow.  the cnn producer i talked to said he doubted they paid. no 1 morning show cred got it. it's always the fringe benefits...luxury honeymoon in nyc compliments of , now that's a scandalabc!   wesley lowery seeking credible reporting? rotflmao!!!    post michael brown's criminal record. i dare you.“: tweets darren wilson paid by abc for interview. abc told  not true &amp; i've seen no credible report to contrary”  children who come from homes with domestic violence are more prone to violence. truth why won't you believe the conspiracy man? the facts are out there  disagree. real journalists research every lead but don't report irrelevant facts to get attention  look to jj harper. karma     reading through this thread shows the crazy crackpotedness  that the media has fostered. embarrassing. dangerous. wow. missed that along the way   was he paid for photos?  well he can't exactly go back to work now, can he? who cares if they paid him? he didn't ask for all this?  i agree. abc needs to come clean. did they pay anything, if so, for what. they're being silly right now.  abc has a rep for this kind of thing. rather than paying for interview, they'll ""license"" a family photo. two extremely bad reports guy must be in line for the razzies of journalism. i can't recall so many inaccurate...or worse...posts over a story.  especially on fb.  well let's hope its not true because shonda rhimes cant save them from the backlash.   avoid triple negatives. you've seen no evidence her was paid? ""news"" pays for photos etc. avoids direct payment.  alternet?  yeah that source has definitely lost credibility.   yeah right, networks don't pay 4 interviews but it's a shell game, pay for use of images instead   why shouldn't he give the interview to the highest bidder. abc won.  is routine. but everyone, on both sides, have denied payment. (but see my prior rt from )   progressives dismiss actual facts (gj evidence, autopsy) and make up facts. nothing new.  maybe abc paid 1 million for the shaving cut that he got😡   abc added to the problem.  didn't need to hear from him so soon!  anderson cooper tweeted that he met with wilson when wilson was intv shopping. what made him pick abc if not $$$"	1

 _europe     que opinan los médicos mexas _mx  ?     _europe      hey doc, if spitting was the solution, this wouldn't be a problem.  _europe     double negative there, please clarify this tweet as to whether ibuprofen is generally recommended to treat covidー19 or not.   _europe     has the company who manufactures most of the core ingredient being investigated after whistleblower complaints recently?  _europe     include taiwan in  so we can fuckin help   _europe     i don’t know. who does it?  _europe     this is the most confusing statement ever: “does not recommend against...” do we avoid it or not?  _europe         _europe     following  _europe     this is better info.  _europe     perhaps people would be more clear on this topic without the double negative.  _europe     who should recommend against use of ibuprofen at any time infectious disease is a risk. ibuprofen is contraindicated when heightened immune responses are needed. these nsaids inhibit antibody production. do not use!!!   _europe     what about now?

  what will happen if we don't wear masks? probably acquire herd immunity in the long run and grow stronger, but that would come at the cost of the lives of elders and immunocompromised. look at what is happening in sweden. look at what happened in italy back in march..  i dont believe the elderly are in any more danger than they are during flu season. we have been lied to  what makes you think so?ok hypothetical question, if you believe that they are more in danger as scientific evidence was convincing enough to you. would you willing to sacrifice ur autonomy and wear a mask? or are you more of a believer in survival of fittest?  survival of the fittest has nothing to do with it. we all look out for ourselves and our kin. if there was evidence that there is a deadly virus out there, killing left and right, we wouldn't need the media to tell us. if it was dangerous, i'd be doing the right thing  the virus isn't deadly in sense of killing everyone sporadically, but it targets elders and hrg. it's nothing like flu which kills 600k out of 1 billion (0.1%) in 2019 where as as it has claimed over 400k over out 8 millions confirmed cases in 4 months only.  sorry but i've heard all these arguments debunked numerous times that i wouldn't even know where to start. if you think this virus is so dangerous then i'm sorry but you've been had. false death certificates and people dying of other causes is just the tip of the iceberg	0
so: this money to cover 80% of the salaries of retained workers who are not working due to a coronavirus shutdown. what is “a coronavirus shutdown” and how is it proved?does this mean employers have to go through a redundancy process and then shout “psych! not really! gonna get a government grant, but you’re taking a salary cut”? again: what is the test for this? really interested in the details here… this is making some sense now: you send employees on gardening leave &amp; you get a grant for a significant proportion of their wages. then i think the vat deferral functions as a loan to bridge the period while the gov gets the structures to pay in place…?  i was initially “yes, at fucking last some assistance”, but now i’m not so sure. it now seems like it could be a load of hurdles (wages cover), and effectively a 0% loan (vat deferral) which isn’t nothing, but doesn’t seem super useful in the absence of a economic expansion.	0

 your thoughts- have we successfully achieved the original goal of flattening the curve? what is our antibody rate? what does it look like as we get closer to herd immunity? what would our numbers look like if our nh cases and deaths were at the national average? 1/2 sorry, i don’t see part 1/2 in this thread or my replies… i’m no twitter expert.  i will try to find it. i think minnesota has probably “flattened the curve” so far — we never hit a point where the health system as a whole was being overwhelmed, forcing people to go without treatment. (that’s not to say that couldn’t still happen down the road.) i haven’t seen any recent data estimating the share of minnesotans who’ve been infected, so i can’t speak to antibody rates.mn’s nursing home covid deaths are worse than our neighbors, but middle-of-the-pack nationwide — way better than the worst states. 	0

"so people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies (serology) from the total. is this consistent with what is being observed?covid19 9/xa ubiquitous assumption made is, that at the start, all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as sar-cov-2. but is this assumption always correct?covid197/xas a pandemic evolves, the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered. it is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease.covid198/xmost serologic assays have ranged from 1-3% all the way up to 20-30% in areas such as new york city. and the curve seems to be ending in nyc.  what gives?covid1910/xsimilarly, in a recent study of an isolated alpine community in austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected.covid1911/xit seems the pandemic has stopped in that community, with a high antibody prevalence of 42.4%. notably, children were less likely to be infected.covid1912/xin another study, it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected, with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ace2 receptor.covid19 13/xanother fascinating study of a ship expedition to the antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected.h/t  covid19 14/xso it seems likely we cannot estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific sar-cov-2 protective antibodies.covid19 15/xhow could this be? is it possible not all are likely to be infected? i suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical. i will share two possibilities others have explored.covid19 16/xthe most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human/primates/mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross-immunity derived from other coronaviruses.covid19 17/xthis is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure. perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past! thank you!covid19 18/x how could we be protected? it is impossible to tell. our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science.  maybe polymorphisms in receptors, immunity, or other ways. we might never know. but we do know evolutionary pathways selectcovid19 19/xanother possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. one such study has shown that as a possibility. they found t cell reactivity from viable t cells stored before sars-cov-2. in nearly one-half of cases!covid19 20/xthis study was small but very provocative. if confirmed, this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the ""s"" (as in susceptible). in other words, you can be functionally ""immune"" even if not exposedcovid1921/ximportantly, and somewhat obvious, they will not have typical sar-cov-2 antibodies. but they may still have protective cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses.covid19 22/xit would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick. low hanging fruit!covid1923/x modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets (proteome) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies.covid19 24/xit is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity. that would explain why there are clusters among families or friends.  and also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers.covid1925/xglobally we have heard from colleagues in peru, ecuador and greece saying “the parking lots were full, we had no more beds.  they are gone”covid1926/xthe problem is we have no reliable way of knowing who is susceptible, and how is not.  i do not recommend anyone reads this as a way to relax our safety measures.  but hopefully this give you hope.covid1927/x highly recommends i read the a camus book. highly descriptive of the current situation.covid1928/xin the meantime stay safe, use masks in public, quarantine yourself if ill. and remain hopeful.covid1929/x"	0

   can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?che l'indicazione è stare a casa, non girare, se si può.  altre indicazioni sensate sono qua su questo sito del ministero  , pare che gli asintomatici non siano particolarmente in grado di contagiare non è vero che gli asintomatici non siano particolarmente in grado di contagiare,  lo ha ripetuto spesso.   ancora co'burioni?  avete anche rotto un po'io cosiddetti. i dati e le direttive delle autorità sanitarie no e le chiacchiere di un egomaniaco in cerca di like sono oro colato?   speriamo bene che gli asintomatici non contagino. una cosa è certa che gli asintomatici , come tali, tossiscono o starnutiscono meno degli altri. comunque l'obiettivo è evitare il tilt del sistema sanitario, mica come qui    who e ecdc dicono la stessa cosa .   sì, che anche gli asintomatici possono contagiare.	0

but, sporting events, concerts, disney are all closed for a reason. covid-19 is just like the flu. realistically we will all eventually get this, just like we have all had the flu before. but this is a new virus that needs to be slowed down for our medical field to catch up.tower thread - the fact people are going out to crowded public areas (bars for the most part) is mind boggling. yes younger people (under 55/60) are mildly effected for the most part (unless you have a preexisting illness). but any age is still just as contagious as the next.you can have covid-19 and not show a single symptom. then go visit your grandparent/parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint. so many people are so uneducated on covid-19. yes the media has completely overblown this.the only way to allow the medical field to catch up is social distance yourself. if you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly (e.i. china &amp; italy) causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with covid-19 that may or may not be ina critical condition. on top of that that, it’s the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up, then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out. it’s not a beat it, it’s a slow it down.as young people in society it’s our duty to slow this virus down. avoid social gatherings, avoid large crowds, wash your fucking hands, wipe down machines at the gym, socially distance yourself. if you have mindset of “i’m young, and this really doesn’t effect me”, then not onlyare you being selfish but you’re the route cause for spreading. in 2 weeks, the people out in public crowds now are going to be the same people complaining when all nonessential companies (medical, emergency, food sources) are closed for 3 weeks to try and control all this.	1

     covid-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates. from the evidence so far, the covid-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather.theresa tam is canada's anthony fauci [only better]. canada's derek sloan would fit right into the crazy end of the republican party. that's all you need to know.    it is honestly embarrassing how much hate this woman receives, and i really don't understand why. (i'm guessing racism and sexism play a part.)    ..and your theory is based on said testing? please verify.     it has been confirmed the virus cant stand heat.for the small cost of heating/savings from turning off air conditioning, life can be saved.the chinese dr.s that have beat this have told us vitamin c + heat kill the virus. it is relatively easy to kill as caught in early stages     the human body is at a constant temp.. even when the exterior is hotter. so, 85° f would ( possibly kill of surface virus).. but you cannot increase  body temp 30°c ..without killing them ,  maybe  you can just pop them in a oven for a while ? lol...     virus lives on surfaces such as tongue, nostrils, throat for a long time before it reaches  lungs. inhaling warm air such as in a sauna or hot environment would kill or inhibit growth of virus on these surfaces. sunshine, sauna, coughing out phlegm with the virus is recommended.     sure. just take the stats from mexico. compare them to the stats on europe.     it would be great if you could share a link to these stats. thanks	0

" herd immunity no sooner than november 4th.  correct love your books. but love when more your passion for the truth also, vaccines are more lucrative than good old cheap common sense herd immunity. national action requires a pelosi congress, who would allocate everybody's savings away and destroy the economy.this has always been the plan. it was done against bush with not even a twitch, and they expect to do it again. in brazil this information is coming from blood banks, which test every donation. in rio de janeiro the antibody rate went from 4% in april to 14% in may, and 28% in the beginning of june.in the us the red cross should certainly have this info. why isn't it available?  that's a great point! antibody tests are important if for no other reason, they still don't know how long the antibodies last and/or resist reinfection.  no one has yet to be able to answer that but i assume they are still testing to determine? who knows?  my bro works for a biotech company who makes covid tests and because covid mutates so slowly (unlike influenza) there should be lasting immunity. which also means if enough people get it, it will fade away completely. just like sars and mers (both coronaviruses) because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunity's work. harris county's mask edict has just been extended until late august. by which time this would have been over any way. but now the can say ""see! look at what my mask edict accomplished!""  yikes. that makes sense. but it's so sickening in it's sneakiness. what about the cdc anti body testing done in late march/early april? in the early days everyone said this can’t be a hoax because the whole world is locking down. ok. fair. now flip the situation: why is only the us locking down (to this extent) again? 🤔 red cross,in va at least, is testing every person donating blood for covid19 antibodies. for a limited time. lowest us death total for a tuesday since march 25. i imagine team apocalypse will still be screaming for lockdowns when we hit zero deaths. you and others with a big audience must keep asking for this and promoting it until decision makers get it. keep up the great work! right after the election same thing is happening in houston  smh. so why hasn't gov abbott been mentioning this of late, if at all? great work alex.  of the recent pandemics which ones have the designed successful vaccines?aids/hiv, colds, sars, mers, h1n1?   they only get the flu right every once in a while. governor polis just shut down bars for 30 days.   is actively discouraging companies, universities etc from doimg any antibody testing. elections.....  agreed!vaccine is aqcuired immunity in the herd, otherwise it's natural herd immunity. people that think vaccines are the answer, don't realize they are actually for herd immunity. they don't realize vaccines are not harmless,either. ohio was supposed to have the results of theirs in may...for some reason we are still waiting  airlines are (obv) businesses &amp; they have been working on a committee with the president to get back to opening up our country. fireworks at the state level xcld bc some govs dont want happiness &amp; prosperity or anything positive happening that would help trump get re-elected. a friend asked his dr. to authorixe antibody test in utah. dr. said not reliable enough &amp; wouldn’t. what's happening in nc?  that's my question...i live in nc. yeah, be a real shame if herd immunity was achieved naturally before a vaccine can be rushed to market.  nih has been performing one. results will be out in the next month or two.  112 n no a v because reliable tests aren’t out there alex, be careful with antibody tests. body deals usually so easy with the sars cov 2, that most of people don't even develop antibodies.  is that when the often mentioned t- cells come into the picture? _law i'm not sure what you mean but maybe i get some of it? i believe that there are no coincidences ever. so how is it that all the events happening are right on time? for something. how can the virus do what it's doing very methodically and specifically at certain times and places alex, what's happening in nc?  i live here and all i hear is gloom and doom.  despite the numbers our own illustrious  dashboard tells us.  great article! 👍 new york city antibody results were over 20% two months ago. i would expect that they are much higher now, but there has been silence on that issue. assuming 20% positive on nyc antibody test, that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from nyc alone. my guess is the real antibody results in nyc are much higher, which is good news, not bad news, of course, because it leads to herd immunity. it's even more fundamental. ""novo"" wuhan virus found in waste water samples in spain - in early 2019. the whole fauci narrative was bs from day one.  the deaths are seasonal, predictable and many are the result of malpractice  it’s irrelevant because by fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero. they won’t be able to hide that glaring fact. i suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming, since it endangers the narrative. the cdc says for every 1 case we identified, there were at least 10 we didn’t.  fauci claimed yesterday the us would see 100,000 cases per day. do the math.  we have been well over his number for some time.  we are now identifying those by testing people who aren’t ill. and two months ago they said that’s what needed to happen, more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms.  now they are saying that’s bad bad because, well that’s a lot of cases.  i feel like we are being punked. nefarious? they want this to continue? or incompetence?  pharmaceutical industrial complex  has fda eua approved covid- 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities! this will help identify those with antibodies! antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around. talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry, molecular, or microbiology field, they will tell you the same thing. ￼""new research from karolinska institutet and karolinska university hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic covid-19 demonstrate so-called t-cell-mediated immunity to the new coronavirus, even if they have not tested positively for antibodies."" probably because they're saying the tests are inaccurate. 🤷‍♀️  what are you referring to in nc? fredericksburg va this morning my husband was talked out of antibody test by doctor because she said they’re inconclusive and pointless. my wife and i did our part to reduce the death rate by surviving covid.  it wasn't fun but almost everyone who get it survives--including almost every person in the u.s. workforce.  have politicized covid because restarting the economy helps trump. likely adding the number of “positive  antibodies” test results in with the “covid positive” results.  it’s easier to fluff the numbers that way 🤨 cause it is “all covid” ...  herd immunity will never be achieved for corona viruses. just like it doesn't exist for influenza viruses.it will or mutate and become part of life or mutate and disappear. my guess is the second one.   it can’t mutate and disappear, bc literally natural selection. also coronavirus family don’t drift antigenically with a rate remotely resembling influenza. the red cross is now offering free antibody testing with a blood donation. hopefully that data will be aggregated and released. also, i look forward to seeing this one on  in two weeks  well you live in ny - enjoy. while good news, think we’ve a longer way to go to get to herd immunity. alex, what’s happening in n.c. haven’t seen any stats. their website is not much help. no actual number for hospitalization and nothing about antibodies.cc:   the nc study is not randomized. these volunteers are self selected. i haven't requested an antibody test because i don't think i have had the virus. please stop calling it a randomized study. according to these swedish researchers antibody tests under count infected by 2x!  nyc could easily be at 60% if they are right.   what is happening in nc? it’s funny seeing people talk about the ins and outs of things like herd immunity and nucleic acid/ anti body test that probably never heard of any of those things 3 months ago. compare to other countries -- if we are so far behind then other countries must assuredly be ahead of us.i don't think it's that easy.   in the early stages the virus is too spotty go get a grip on it for something useful. dude are you arguing herd immunity is achieved at 30%  nyc seroprevalence is around 25% and we see immunity playing a huge role. not abolishing the virus as herd would, but it’s ability to spread is extremely limited in ny. angry twitter man has found all the answers  arithmetic has good reason to be angry with us all these days. and t-cell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies.  new york, italy, etc seems to show that we're nearing herd immunity, like it or not.  not sure about doing things ny or italian style. they basically euthanized the vulnerable by using nursing homes for cv19 patients. mental midgets.  hundo p i thought nih was doing this? i volunteered but apparently was not selected.. madness, we are in the hands of luddites,  cretins &amp; covidiotinchief i think you are gonna be right.  or close.  but the evidence will be, i think, on worldometer or similar.  deaths for sure are way down.  let's see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon.  i hope so. we will not see a widespread, accurate antibody test because each person who tests positive is one less customer for a vaccine shot. um...no.i don't know if you noticed, but new york was a bit tense while all that was going on confirmation for all the “just wait two weeks” ninnies, karens, and npcs. they are gonna fight hard, but keep sharing the data. can’t hide from the truth: it could be that there are so many reliability problems with the antibody testing kits. what’s happening in nc? what did i miss? why is  not demanding this? another day another article. ..now they say test for t-cells and not for antibodies. .."" for every person testing positive for antibodies, two were found to have specific t-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.""do we know what to test ? can you try to make these results available? and that would wipe out the pretext for mail-in voting in november. gotta make it last to november, then it will all go silent we don't know because the cdc is not treating this ""viral disease"" like a real emergency that requires excellent data and surveillance. they are treating it like a political bludgeon. clear data would hamper their mission. so what is the end game here, who is benefitting from falsely keeping us all in panic ? the only semblance of  malice i can think of is that some public health experts have a tiny bit more amount of fame.   antibody tests that are positive for antibodies is like having your own vaccine on board.do more testing for antibodies, viral tests when symptomatic.covid19 covid19tx_o_v_e_truth    can someone more well informed than myself please explain to me, if it's possible to have both t cells and antibodies present for the same pathogen? or do the t cells (if present) automatically override/ cancel out the abs? did you see this study from karolina ka in sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people don’t produce antibodies but produce an effective t cell immune response?     remember when birx said on april 1, 2020,”there is no more flu”. after that day any flu deaths were counted as covid. we stupidly went along and believed anything they said. meanwhile arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care. resources are being rationed and people are dying that could have been saved. might wanna do a bit more research on antibody testing you will never get that data. the last thing democrats want is the true on this hoax to get out. they want us wearing bacterial-laden petri dishes on our faces, to make us sick, so that in october, when we all have respiratory illnesses they can yell “covid! covid! see? its covid! no voting in person! close the polls”   _law so i heard someone on oan news said that the numbers of new cases are being cooked but my thought is what if it's worse than that what if they are using manipulated test kits somehow it's surely possible every other thing going on? this graph represents herd immunity.  isn’t this what we want?   of course, they can manage to produce tests that over report positives by 50% but not antibody testing.  it's like the media wants to propagate the scam, as if they have a motive to harm the leader of the country's popularity or something. the cdc has shown itself to be another incompetent, self perpetuating government bureaucracy.  random covid19 testing should have started in january 2020.   without random testing you have no idea of what’s happening.   the cdc is clueless. so let’s just let it spread and we will find out.  hey! dr.  you retweeting crazy conspiracy theories is really going to help out  win those center moderate voters!  keep up the great work 👍 i’ve been asking this the whole. it’s odd herd immunity would upset the plans; mail in ballots, fear for control, vaccines for all, contact tracing which really is the ground work for ""social score""; most of all marxist take over. they don't want this to end....anything to prolong the assault on liberties and freedom.....and anything to get rid of trump. what is happening in nc?  a little background of truth.  nc is just now starting to test nursing home residents and workers in the facilities.  just now.  50% of nc deaths are from nursing homes. looking at the real stats. _donga blame the idiot in chieftrumpkillsus if you are uncovering asymptomatic infections in a major way, we are closer to the end of the pandemic than most people realize. isn’t it the darkest before dawn?  i hope you are right. i want this over. i can’t take it anymore. we are being scammed. the testing and metrics for case positive numbers are shit. positive because u maybe talked to someone with covid?????  this whole situation is completely fucked with a bunch of morons pointing to data that is worthless out of the gate. junk in junk out.  open the country now posting this again. this seems to be correct. and this: they are all going to deny herd immunity until november 4. their followers are not exactly difficult to manipulate. nj governor just “paused” indoor dining although covid burned out here months ago. explain the ""what is happening in nc is happening everywhere""?  earlier tonight there was a report that north carolina antibody testing showed 17% exposure implying a very low ifr which would mean the virus has fewer to infect and is not as lethal to those it does.  why did they scream in march we need more tests. now we are doing it and now they are like shut it down. the left gives me a headache.   really?? come on  why are you giving us this information?"	0

"      it’s used in emergency situations, and in combination with other drugs. the fda commissioner and cdc have both said it’s still in trials, but may work. my point is that saying covid-19 is just like the flu and we have drugs already is reckless at best.      “the fda approved a drug that has no clinical trials nor proof of working for covid-19 so we’re all good” is a terrible argument.      opium isn’t a new drug either. just because a drug has been used for one thing doesn’t mean it will work on another - and there is currently zero proof chloraquine will kill off covid-19. so assuming everything will be fine because of said drug is dangerous.      it is an anti-viral drug with zero proof that it works on covid-19 at this time.      the south korean groups warned that there is ""currently no standard treatment for covid-19.”“patients showing severe pneumonia-like symptoms, high-risk groups including the elderly and the chronically ill, are target groups for a more ""active"" administration of the drugs.”      the treatments for a flu are tested for months or years - chloroquine has just started fda clinical trials for treatment of covid-19. i hope a treatment is found, no matter where it comes from. i just don’t like the hyping of a drug as the cure when it hasn’t been fully tested."	1

    i’m nuts? the “what” is covid-19. it has killed almost 60,000 people in the usa in two months. it would have killed many thousands more without social distancing.update from mayor  on covid-19:-7 new cases monday, adjusted total of 473 known, confirmed covid-19 cases-riverside facility now able to test residents, frontline workers both with and without symptoms-regional approach to re-opening parks with 6 municipalities   very nice to expand access to testing in this way.  building on success with flattening curve in city.   the curve is flat. we have a single digit daily case count for over a week in a city of 50k people. if that isn't flat please tell me what is?   there were 84 cases last week with the revisions from backlog (week ending 4/25) — average of 12/day.  great progress, but more cases than the last week of march.  it’s a good idea to keep slowing it down before loosening restrictions.     maybe so maybe no.  we have 473 cases in hbkn, with 19 deaths so a .04% mortality rate.  25% of nyc has antibodies according to cuomo, so around 2.1m people had it.  the mortality rate with 17k deaths is what, .008%?  they kept their parks open.  who did it better?     if i were mayor, i’d be opening parks. doubt  that parks play any role in transmissions.  but i don’t have all facts, data, and expert advice.  i also think that it is one of the least important sacrifices of this very unpleasant period.	0

is it safe to receive a letter or a package from china?yes, it is safe. people receiving packages from china are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. from previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation. can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?no. spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-ncov)?at present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. however, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.this protects you against various common bacteria such as e.coli and salmonella that can pass between pets and humans. do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov. although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?no. there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. however, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. however, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?no. sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. there are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-ncov on surfaces. these include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.however, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. it can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-ncov). older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-ncov).however, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

      you're right that it's not an argument. you haven't shown at all how private entities regulated by other private entities would ensure testing accuracy and reliability so that they can be used to deal with a pandemic. you've deflected an awful lot, though.      i reject your burden of proof. if i put in the work you will only move the goalposts and use false equivalencies. i do not think you are having this conversation in good faith. you have not even been able to answer a very specific use case for your alt hypothesis. take care.      1/2 yes, the specific use case of covid19 tests that are sensitive and reliable, which are both preconditions to being medically useful. the current fda processes for proving test function are adequate.      2/2 while the bureaucracy itself could have moved faster in this specific crisis, that failure does not invalidate the utility and need for functional standards &amp; enforcement. you are arguing against this, therefore burden of proof lies with you. has not been met at all.      you should actually read that fda release. it isn't doing what you seem to think it is. burdens of proof within euas still required, clia still required. devolving central regulatory authority to state-level regulatory authority is also included. regulations not suspended.	0

 what is your take on the pre-existing cross-immunity idea and how it affects the herd immunity number?  some estimates suggest that 50% or more of the population may not be susceptible at all to covid.  herd immunity may therefore kick in much sooner in the us. agreed we are probably some ways off.  but then again, no one knows how much cross-immunity different populations may have.  is it 30%, 50%, 80%?  brazil seems to be doing the least to suppress it, so that may be one place to watch.	0
 _katie   again, what percentage do we need to be infected to reach herd immunity and what is the mortality rate according to you?unfortunately high covid ’s are now baked in for next 2-3 weeks because they reflect infections 7 to 21 days earlier.focus now must be getting numbers to plateau &amp; start falling by mid-july &amp; preventing young &amp; healthy people from infecting those older &amp;/or at higher risk need to shut florida down... looks like he is in a race to catch new york. _katie   that’s completely incorrect. herd immunity for basic virus is 50-60% without vaccine.	0

can i catch covid-19 from my pet? no. there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19.older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19? no. antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19? not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019.however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized.is covid-19 the same as sars? no. the virus that causes covid-19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid-19.should i wear a mask to protect myself? only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19.the mask can only be used once.if you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.is there anything i should not do? the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:1. smoking2. taking traditional herbal remedies 3. wearing multiple masks 4. taking self-medication such as antibiotics.in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.coronaalert coronavirus coronaoutbreakthread	0

   can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  see previous answer on “how does covid-19 spread?”   similar info on health canada website   people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.   this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.   quoting who... sorry to flood your mentions lol. stay safe everyone!	0

 if not why? did any member of congress go while on vacation for 6wks?  if not, stfu! get a life donald..i only wish i could steal as good as you so i could be a billionaire he can be everywhere and nowhere  his death is sad but is his life worth more than the other soldiers lost during a war that shouldn't be? he was too busy going to a late night talk show , golf, basketball game. he was a general, not a jihad that was the reason why he did not attend the funeral! why do you hate on obama all the time the president doesn't go to soldiers funerals because you shouldn't give more weight to one soldiers death over another. donald you're wrong. it would be a travesty had he attended norespect what do you expect from him donald? he is busy playing cover-up for al-assad indirect support and regional failure yse ygyt _wallace it's the the 1st time i ever agreed with something trump had to say. i do not think a president in the past was able to attend every memorial service. have we forgetten the one he did attend. we as americans that stand loyal with our troops can't expect nothing less from a ""narcissist."" obama is a very sick man! every word that you speak further confirms you as a petty, narrow-minded, partisan moron. 😏 have you attended the funeral of every employee thats died while working for you? atravesty why? it won't bring him back or make it any easier? it doesn't help me any ? you are a fucking troll lmao   have you just woke up from your snoring sleep to recognize barack obama as president of usa and c-in-c. shame he could've at least mention him in one of his many rants true to that sir!  add it to the mountain of travesties he and his gang have committed. nothing new here  he's the golfer-in-chief not the commander, just ask anyone in the military shut up trump! did you go? you think you're the president.  no one wanted that sob in attendance, only real americans were welcome rt - palestinian children aspire to death as martyrs: ""everyone yearns for suicide-killing""  nor did vp biden or sec. of defense hagel. disgraceful.. did you go, donald?

you are such a fucking moron if you felt so strongly about it, why did you attend? what a fucking drama queen.  you and lindsey grahm must have a case of the tight ass vapors.  squirrel  he didn't know about it.   he didn't see it on the news. the president is more concerned with his golf game and vacation. very sad. sends a bad message to the military. choices  the prez has serious issues with his golf swing, i mean, have you seen it? it looks like a caveman killing lunch was bush there? rumsfeld? cheney? what about the oil ceo's who's interests we are there for in the first place? why is this different than any other soldier kiled in combat? did you go?  the man is busy running the world so shut your pie hole. the real travesty is obama. he did the family a favor by keeping his worthless face out of view. a travesty of what? besides, if he had attended, people would just complain that he was ignoring his other duties right? fuck obama! every man has his faults. he was smart in the sense of getting votes from mexicans by opening the border. pretty sure he's more occupied     _johnny  one word miles, google sure was. this thug shows no respect to military. because he was playing golf on my corse is it necessary? no excuse, not even if he was playing a trump course!  he should be removed from office immediately!  oh grow up you don't lead by good example ... there is nothing honorable in constantly finding fault w potus  hey don, i'll give you a chico stick and tub of i can't believe it's not butter for your toupee. hit me up dog! did you really think he would give up a vacation day? obama is just titled commander and chief as well as potus, neither makes it so. what a disgraceto our country.bama b bizzzzy!        - nelson, it's a travesty people are out to find fault. irrelevant to the post. don's a genius. he overcomes &amp; triumphs! ;-) i agree with you sir! - his actions prove how little regard he really has for our military and veterans. did you attend??

    houston death rate is 550 people out of 6m.  what is nyc?  houston had not built up any herd immunity like nyc.  the protests were like a grenade into the phased process.  houston icu's were at 64% for non-covid due to the shut downs.  now delayed again.  high cost for protests.so the rise in covid cases is because we’ve opened up and not the massive protests? ok....i see the new talking point. ugh. can we get someone..anyone...to report news and stop with the talking points?   “more positive cases” doesn’t mean anything at this point. testing has increased exponentially, and there are duplicate cases reported where people are tested more than once. my mother-in-law in a retirement home was tested at least 4 times with 3 positive results.	0

  i guess the counter question is why do we need it? not one soap mentioning corona virus 🤔they usually incorporate world events x it's too hard to with the situation changing several times  daily. the insert they film could be out of date by the time it goes out. they probably have other things to worry about like keeping the shows running and the staff and procedures safe and don't need the extra work  genuine question, not being a cow, how hard would it be to film two characters already doing a scene in the pub to slip on/off a jacket and complain about empty shelves in the kabin/minute mart/ price slice?  soaps based on real life and the corona virus is part of lives now.. they don't have to have stats, maybe humour like singing happy birthday while washing hands before serving customers at the cafe 😁.. just reinforce what government has said 👀  for many it's not really funny though is it? so i don't think ee taking the mick with hand sanitiser would cheer them up   exactly. i'm already staying/working from home due to the coronavirus. one person in the town where i teach has contracted the virus. now schools are shut down. i don't want to watch my favorite soaps talking about it.	0

what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?- regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.why? washing with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.why? when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets.- avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.- make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately.covidー19 covidstay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. follow the directions of your local health authority.covidー19 covid covid19france covid19france covid_19	0
 historically it has been to do serology or blood tests for pathogen-specific antibodies. this study suggests that this may not be as useful over time.  which brings up other than live virus re-exposure tests, if there is protection, what is the best test? again, time will tell. 2/n we know that immune protection exists in animal and monkey testing upon re-exposure. however, many have used antibody titers as a test to check immune memory in the clinic. this may unfortunately not be as useful for covid-19. booster vaccine shots can be given if needed. however, we don’t know how those who’ve been infected already, but then have reduced antibody levels, will respond to re-exposure. the same or different?  for those who haven’t had it yet, no one wants to run that risk.	0

how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales.can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.world health organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. 	0

"sabcnews fact of the day: 5g mobile networks do not spread covid-19.covid19insa day20oflockdown sabcnews  don't forget to inform thes masses about the amount of radiation it gives off &amp; the effects it'll have on their health, we'll then come back for conspiracy theories._lwazi  where is the peer reviewed(!) evidence that it does? iam sure 5g has its own health issues but there is no link between 5g and covid 19 i don’t know how true this is,but if it is,how then do we curb the spread if departments are telling people to go back to work?? 5g doesn't cause covid-19 and those who say 5g causes radiation there's two type ionising and non-ionising the bad one is the ionising and the one that's ""good"" is the non-ionising of which frequencies are measured by means of electromagnetic spectrum.  big scepticism towards any ""facts"" the media puts forward. with so many contradicting ""facts"" flowing around, best to accept the safest version, especially if these ""facts"" are not substantiated by trustworthy sources. if 5g is faster and it spreads this virus does this mean 4g and the rest was then slowly making us sick? dont they all have to some extend emit radiation. you'll really need to give us hard evidence to prove what you are saying of course. but we will keep destroying them because they are harmful! why don't you update us about covid 19 stats that is killing folks now, we will worry about 5g later, am sure you don't have scientific evidence for the sort of harm 5g has either... is it right for a general worker at a private hospital to be sent to a public hospital when they have signs of contracting covid-19 which they picked up at work? facts mus be followrd up with proof.. or else ont say it's a fact fokkof yall have been instructed to tell us that lol, did people belief the lie that they are linked 🤣  if it did in some countries why here in south africa won't? don't tell us but show us the research evidence report. evidence has shown this will need massive job to deschool some disciples to this theory! otherwise it's also a looming disaster in the shelves!    please watch this link. this ad by microsoft was since removed and replaced with a different version after huge negative backlash which fool can believe such bull. 5g is technology and covid19 is a virus 😅😅😅😅😅😅 wow! do u know  ?????  come see this🤣🤣🤣 tell us wat it does then! we need to knw its disadvantages too...u are a public broadcaster sont just make a statement without explaining now that you've said it i have more reasons to believe it does it does kill bees though 🤷‍♀️ just saying there is no conclusive evidence why should we donate for covid 19 with our airtime to telkom... when telkom is the only big telecommunications and network installer in the country ,are we finding the 5g installation with our airtime in the name of covid19..? then why are birds dying when they stand on the towers of 5g? u who said it does?or you guys know something we don't? leave us alone, we have more to worry about than 5g, tsek day20oflockdown,paysaexpressstaff sa express staff still waking up to this harsh reality of not being paid during covid-19,no food, no essentials, some facing eviction, please sa retweet to make gov pay sax salaries y nd what exactly is a 5g nd y their busy wit it in this difficulties course we only want the vaccine that wil help our people only even if 5g is the problem they won’t tell us because there’s big money to be made out of it. why haven't anyone talked about it. just posting a poster about 5g won't convince the people that 5g is save.please get experts on board like:1)5g expert2) health expert3) law expert on technologies that causes health risks.just poor journalism. only people spread the virus flu like symptoms from 5g... the issues no one knows dont make conclusions... here is what science (not the china) says...day19oflockdown lockdownhouseparty coronaviruspandemic cipc  anyway is true it doesn’t spread it but it cause it yeah, but they destroy human health! 5gkills hey wen admin how do you know? 👀😂 then explain this:in china it's true 5g do not spread covad-19, but, it's a source behind man suffering today.    for the world's growth and radical change there is always sacrifices.  so please tell on how are we going to use now africa resources to develop our land and our people &amp; industrialize africa? this has been a topic from 2019 and you  you are only paying interest now? hoekom nou?🤔 ie⁴ so 5g networks neither transmit any radiation as well????....this sounds like the quality of lessons we have been receiving through sabc platforms. we know you are paid to say that but guess what, where there’s a smoke there’s fire. all governments throughout the world don’t know the cause of this covid-19. then why are they quick to criticize those who says 5g is the cause? how can you find a cure not knowing the cause?the most dangerous thing to the world is capitalism because capitalism doesn’t care about life only money 🤣 what pressurized sabc to focus on conspiracy? you guys need to stick to your lane makingnews and leave conspiracy alone,  the virus is created to depopulate the human race as people are saying this is part of the population control plan? are you willing to comment on that to?  proof please. i will be watching on 404 reading the comments with dismay, people actually believe that 5g spread/cause covid19.ignorance &amp; stupidity should be classified as a disease 🤞🏾  if 5g is not a prblm y america destroyed it y chinese was destroying it y u wana make yo self rich with a blood of poor people mxm"	0
  you are 1/2 correct thousand already infected  which means mortality rate is provably lower than the seasonal flu.  this fear is insane and ignorant.     don’t reply just wait and see.  covid-19 is just like the flu.there are at least 4 coronavirus cases in the us that are not travel-related, officials say 11 new cases in san antonio texas. let’s face it, there are thousands of cases in the united states right now that we are not even aware of. this is going to get really bad really fast.  you’re ignorant. i hope you don’t have any loved ones that are in the 15 to 18% mortality rate, which is anyone over the age of 80.  this is nowhere near equivalent to the flu.  it’s worse.  board certified pulmonary and sleep medicine. the elderly account for 70 to 90% of influenza deaths. please stop repeating/spreading panic you do not understand what you are talking about.	1

""he did, he was fobbed off, time &amp; again""is there any actual proof to back up your claim here?    there may be in the minutes. you’ll have to ask the spfl, specifically nd &amp; rm, why the minutes weren’t signed off for months.as it is, the reaction of rangers satisfies me that they were getting fobbed off. that’s why we are where we are now.    the minutes should have been signed off, and any other concerns dealt with but it's absolutely bizarre that no one, not one single person, brought these issues to light, until dundee's vote got lost in the spfl computer system.    no. i'm  saying he should have brought the issues up at the time. i think rangers thought something dodgy went down when dundee's vote was lost, came out shouting, and when it was shown to be a glitch in the system, rangers have tried to justify their initial claim of corruption    show me where rangers claimed corruption. point it out in a statement, in the dossier, or in an interview or on the website.you said it, back it up."	0

"breaking news: pope francis’ encounter with kim davis wasn’t an endorsement of her views, the vatican says. tactician. figured that, the douchebag pope wouldn't actually follow the bible, its not to his liking. then why did he feel the need to meet with her? sure. he just chose her at random. could have been you or me. yea, right. this is breaking news?. the meeting was unfortunate nonetheless. why did  even give her the time of day? did he also meet with ?. and it appears not to be much of an encounter. davis with the warhol clock running down... why did he include veiled follow up remarks during flight home?  damage control, but the damage is done. very disappointed. it shouldn't have happened at all.  backtracking bullshit this morning!  if the wh were spinning this damage control they would've said kim davis was needing counsel about entering into her 5th marriage.   liar. coward. hypocrite. who cares iam sick if this kim davis woman getting attention ... yes i respect her belief but move on kim davis appears to have exploited people her entire life.she apparently thrives off of hurting people, even  slap in face to gays. i have doubt with this pope .. i don't know, very confusing pope ever ! ""i forsay character lies"" good digginns the fastest land acts were the break throughs ofclean spirit this is why 'religiosity' sucks! they can't just take a stand. they have to play to the gallery.  apparently once you're sufficiently holy it's totes ok to be wildly dishonest your idea of what is important and is breaking news is really off. not trending. ok to endorse religious beliefs; not ok to wield beliefs to support punishment of non believers! --a new spin; to stay politically correct, i suppose. prior reports have him supporting her bigoted actions. like catholic church.  they are saying the meeting wasn't private, she was  in a group of people and the pope was not aware of her situation. ummm… doesn't matter. that 15 minute meeting pissed away his credibility with damn near everyone who isn't a against this non-issue.. to be clear, pope francis did not have spiritual relations with that woman.  bigger slap to the catholics! could'nt he find any doing god's work? he chose to bless born again before catholic, sad!"	0

     cool, good thing surgical and cloths masks don’t cause significant hypoxia! ❤️“the prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause co2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency.”     i'm curious...can you provide proof that masks don't work? as mentioned, medical professionals can and do wear them for hours. so if you're having surgery, you'd be ok with the doctor not wearing a mask while standing over your open, susceptible body? god forbid he sneezes.     😍🥰research!!!😍🥰😍“conclusion:the study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for covid-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic.”	0

 _wood1 what is the goal of a vaccine? you guessed it. herd immunity! not everyone can take a vaccine. people used to have measle and chicken pox parties to get it over with. i’m not saying covid is the same disease but this idea you have to hide until there’s a vaccine is moronic  that's just plain not true. we're not declining as a whole around the country but are holding fairly steady as some states improve but others get worse. and i notice you conveniently ignored all of the data i shared providing context to your first graph._wood1  i didn’t ignore anything. arguing on social media solves nothing. you’ll have your opinion no matter what i share._wood1  the fact of the matter is the general population of 18 to 50 that is relatively healthy is going to need to be exposed to covid. it’s called developing heard immunity. hiding in your house from the virus like it’s a cat burglar does not work. i’m not saying not to wear your mask. _wood1 this is false. the vaccine will create immunity as they have for other communicable diseases. there is no need to risk people’s lives until the vaccine because you don’t like a mask. _wood1 you’d rather knowingly let people die to achieve a goal that we will achieve in 6 months without the unnecessary deaths... wait for it... so you don’t have to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth sometimes...bless your heart. good bye	0

can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2what is a coronavirus?coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers, sars and now, covid-19.some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3how does covid-19 spread?people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0
"from who: ""can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air?*studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air."" the above info is from the who whatsapp link below, a few minutes ago. this too though, on march 16:""the everyday person shouldn’t be concerned, van kerkhove said, but medical staff may be susceptible when performing procedures such as intubation — where a tube is placed down a patient’s throat and into their airway to assist with breathing."" nejm  good info. thanks. saw this morning:  yes it is the official advise that i was questioning. however on reading this very comprehensive article i just found on the issue, i think it is indeed sound and this is the study btw which i was referring to(from the same article). i first heard about it from reuters  covid-19 is mrna virus disease and quite similar to sars virus. apart from respiratory droplets infections, this virus has got other high infectious properties. it can enter your body through nose, eyes, mouth hence social distancing and regular hand wash is very important. what if droplets from an infected persons sneeze are floating in the air?the problem here is because this is a new virus, there are  many contradictory messages floating around. like, those without symptoms need not wear a mask. but, many infected persons dont have symptoms."	0

interesting new study on covid19 immunity. if results hold, twice as many have had the infection vs what is visible from antibody tests. how long does this t-cell immunity last? if as long as antibody, we might be closer to herd immunity than thought. another interesting consequence would be that the mortality rate has been overestimated and can be cut to half, approximately 0.3% instead of 0.6% according swedish data	0
