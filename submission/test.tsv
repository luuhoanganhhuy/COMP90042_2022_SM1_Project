Unless this can be proven why report it. It is nothing but speculation  missile path could be from opposite direction, could be a similar US missile triggered by CIA or Ukraine ! is there any doubt that MH was deliberately shot down by russian backed terrorists?

Oh wait it's  so we should expect that Maybe Mr. Trump does not have any more serious issues to focus on. good business is good for economy &amp; it generates employment, why u have to encourage to boycott? when did CNN become trumps mouthpiece...

You don't get an opinion here this doctor is the type that will ALWAYS use people worst experiences to be on top...how insensitive can one be Appreciate that this was aimed at a US audience, but as this is the UK version it would be nice if you corrected the spelling?  u nailed it.The guy is moronic.But I feel he wants to game the system by manipulating our sense Carson's views are inexplicable, it doesn't take a cryptologist to decode that guns kill, let alone a brain surgeon!!! if someone said that bout obumma in , u would call them racist. Thank God someone's noticed.Clearly something wrong w him. He's not fit to be president. Google his quotes. Outlandish comments Ha ha  Wow You're Not a Journalist, You're Just a Big Mouth on TV....and that's the Way it Is Wednesday September th ppl get what you say, sadly you don't get what others say.:-) Nice article on BC. After his Monday FB post I figured he must have taken the Hypocritical rather than the Hippocratic Oath. y do you take pride in insulting people,,,how are u diff.from trump? methinks he is clinically insane. Pedestrian arguments and hollow allusions. golf balls. That's the thing I can't get out of my mind. Holes the size of golf balls. Why do you need a weapon that does that?

Just hush your silly mouth while doing it no vote my way!! I think you'll find the brain of  in LostAndFound gathering dust - lights are on, but no one's home. So whose opinion should I trust?  A brilliant surgeon or cell phone hacking publicity hound from another country.That's tough so to sum you up anti guns, go live in south Chicago who have the strictest gun control laws, also lead the USA in gun violence Would like to know if you have the knowledge to write an article about current BJP regime? this is arguably the most brilliant article ever.

Ben Carson is the most brainless brain surgeon in America Haaaa   out of  go back to England  %  well said and you are full of $!t.  very well said well said,silly man.

I guess when you are filled with hate it has to ooze out quite frequently. you speak and countless Americans yawn......... why won't you write a column about your clueless mate  ?! Are you that scared of him??  What? Ben Carson is so desperate to please the conservative core of his party hence his daft comments on Guns and abortion. That article was so apt.

But not by the people she is protecting! Stand strong! !!! We are proud of you always. she can join my family!  //wow. ever get to talk to the gal shot down in the gulf confrontation to see what her thoughts are on this gal? this is a sad situation. Whether or not agree w/ the bombing, this woman has opened doors for other Mid-Eastern women.  I can't imagine disowning my child... With family like that, she should treat them like an ISIS training camp &amp; bombs away!   huh?? Can you say ""propaganda""?    Are you saying ISIS is true Muslims?.  I understand this is not true..misinformation started by ISIS.  the article makes clear that the ""letter"" was published anonymously &amp; they don't even know if it's real or not.  ..this was made up check your facts.  That might show that deep inside their minds, Muslims radicals are not % of the total Muslim population How  sad is that, she's a hero, I believe that has been refuted by her family.    it's called taqqiya.. basically believers of Islam can lie with permission towards nonbelievers This young lady brought. honor to herself and the UAE.Shows ""feminists"" what a women can achieve in a difficult culture.. Wait a Minute that does not sound right  I'll adopt her/her family must be crapola/we would welcome her on Waltons Mountain.  But most of the world love her. Is that her family practicing female discrimination? I'm sure she can find a better one.  notfair that's anonymous, what proof u have that it's from her family? She is welcome to join my fam..we got a extra room!! _zander The family does not deserve to have somebody as fine as she is to be part of it. She is a hero in my book.

What crummy parents.  Bless her and may she have many, many kills! Shouldn't this brave woman's ID be kept secret? She and her family could be made targets...just sayin _AgainWhy Interesting article.  who the f-k told her family that?! Sad if true because for women in general, her bravery is second to none. She is to be commended at all levels.  good news is, the other % of the world thinks she is a hero  She was never ""owned"" to begin with. If her family ""disowns"" her for this...It's their loss.  emiratis would never go against their govt in public.

Liberals think ISIS are moderate muslims.  Mensouri family did refute the communique with numbers of Tweets according el-Watan:   Very complex. As we saw in Vietnam, Northern Ireland etc one man's hated enemy is another's freedom fighter. 'It's not clear whether... the statement ... is genuine.' It's ISIS propaganda.

Man :( Then someone will argue that you cannot know for sure until the day comes so at best you can only be a floating 'agnostic'. b...but social media is telling me I can! Next thing you're gonna be telling us, we won't be riding hoverboards next summer. Not with THAT attitude We ALL float down here.  the debunking was superb! It would be scary if somehow gravity could just be turned off.. Why is this insanity even a thing? This is completely bonkers. The hoaxers put in the effort of making a fake tweet, but didn't bother checking to see if it was under  characters?  You might if you live in that odd Ontario city with supposedly less gravity than usual? More importantly, even if the gravity were greater than . the Earth would experience it as well ""the placebo effect"", works wonders on the mind. Jan th is my birthday, I was hoping for a special birthday. Gravity like every other day. Boring. Wouldn't an actual Zero G day be really bad? Turning off the one thing that keeps Earth together kind of bad? We won't be allowed to use the letter ""g"" on that day? I expect to weigh  nanogram less.

Can you give us a better hint? What do you mean ""no""? No, as in ""No doubt that we WILL be able to float""? are you planning to be in orbit or the vommit comet? No? Then no. If you believe! That sounds like it'd be neato.  Who do we complain to to make this happen? This is sooooo sad. sigh. will prove you wrong! To the hot tub! I can float any time I want! All I need is a sufficiently large body of water.

The twits at Facebook are big BozO and amnesty supporters Face Book on its continuing quest to support Obama -no matter what &amp; while dismantlg Freedom of Speech at the same time -Good Job An amazing young man. Facebook should be ASHAMED for trying to silence American Patriots. Stand PROUD &amp; continue to speak truth. CJ conducted an amazing interview too.  He really is a tcot Growing to be most thoughtful youth for  tcot   I doubt it, they are democrats I am proud of you young man! Way to stand up and speak up.

CJ you give us hope very impressed young man, but it occurred to me that maybe he was shut down because he was under ,  Facebook's age limit.  Negro Can you say NetNuetrality? CJ you are great, stand up for your rights, we are proud of you. cj for president because the one we have has no morals,guts,or sence of being american,dont worry cj this is what left does. I got tossed from Facebook as well...IDC...i blocked facebook from ever contacting me again.... this young man is awesome. don't you just want to hug this kid.  What tha?!    Hate to say it but when it comes to politics the last thing I care about is a  yr olds opinion.
