"What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are: fever, tiredness, dry cough, and body temperature.Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales These droplets land on objectsand have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong south China.It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States.In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections rangingfrom the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.What is COVID-19?COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread. 	0

12. What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyone!Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.2. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 20193. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.8. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.13.(A)However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:13.(B)Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.13. (C)Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.	0

"Non-essential services shutdown? Can someone explain to me how  is essential while  is not?  Not to mention why it was essential for the military academies to play their football games...  WarOnChildren oil trumps life it probably depends on how the website maint contracts were set-up and where they're feds or contractors running them. (?) Seems priorities are really fucked up in DC. Neither has been updated since the shutdown. One just has a splash page letting us know. Shutdown shouldn't happen, though.  my website costs more or takes more time to shut down rather than just let it stay up! A missing child alert system sounds pretty fucking essential to me. well of course... This is part of the smoke and mirrors. What can we shut down that will piss off the most people?   They do have bandwidth &amp; electricity costs. Plus many gov sites run on AWS cloud at hourly rates. I suppose we should simply let YOU decide what's essential and what's not? Fuck you, dude.

Someone has to be back behind the curtain or it just shuts off right?    probably fuel economy site has a different funding source. Car companies, perhaps? One has to do with money the other just has to human life. We all know what rules politics nowadays. or why Michelle Obamas ""let's move"" food nanny website is still up?  Excellent question! Only 17% of the USG is actually shut down. But Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" site is up and running. Almost other no Fed site up.   it all comes down to when funding was awarded.

Plagiarism is the new virus, what is covid-19?  Covid got competition now 😂 At least turnitin is a cure for this virus	0
MISCONCEPTIONS 1.) COVID-19 is just like the flu/another strain of the flu. 2.) COVID-19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu. 3.) Younger individuals should not be worried about the virus.Of greater concern to younger individuals, and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of COVID-19 in this coming fall. (4) The reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infectall individuals, young and old and typically more virulent as well.(5) Which brings me to point 4.  4.) The actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction.The prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in COVID-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of COVID-19 in the fall able to severelyaffect all individuals as the more COVID-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) The stopping of the spread of COVID-19 now is CRUCIAL to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly,immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. It should also be noted that not extending the course of the COVID-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace asa result of financial need leading to increased spread. (7,8)I would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic, and I applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases.I am, however, passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases. I highly encourage everyone of you to do your research, educate yourself on how you can best help yourself, your family,and your community. The efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort. The actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come.I urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself. REFERENCES1)2)3) 4) 5)6) 7)8)	1

As we reopen Ohio, people will have to be very, very careful until we get a vaccine. You'll have to weigh benefit vs. risk. You will have to make sure you're wearing a mask when you go out, continue social distancing, etc. COVID19 is not going away until we get a vaccine. All y’all responding that it’s YOUR choice he’s not talking about just you. Of course you can make the decision to take the risk but if you get sick it’s not just “your problem.” If the hospitals get overwhelmed that’s HIS PROBLEM. If you end up hospitalized and the nurse who takes care of you catches it and can’t work to help save others or worse yet becomes gravely ill or dies because of you is that still not “your problem!?” WHY CANT WE AS HUMANS care about others more than ourselves?  YOU’RE RIGHT! Numbers don’t lie! I guess I’m just confused where you are getting YOUR numbers... 	0
15. Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous 14. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates 16. Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or any other lung disease. 17. You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life. 18. Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 19. 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19 	0
Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.Pls Don't panic people with fake news because it's not real All Facts are in these threads 	0

  First, it’s Labor, there’s no “u”, second, they were closed prevent the spread of infection, even closing prior to the mandatory shut down of non-essential services. That was a decision made by the park owners, not the Qld Government. Criminal conduct? Bullshit.  You actively want people to die? It is important or limit the spread of infection. That’s the entire point - to prevent EVERYONE from getting it. I would hate to see a second wave, like in Victoria, because infection control isn’t managed.  If herd immunity was a good idea, the federal government wouldn’t have implemented lock down measures, closed off international boarders and promoted social distancing. Herd immunity results in death, it also isn’t doing great things in Sweden. 	0

Can we follow the rules on quarantine and social distancing published by St Georges Unviversitu of London? They seem to be much safer than what we are doing now. They recommend a 2m distance and also they steps and guidelines in disinfecting consultation rooms and test centers If there is no confirmed case passed through food or food packaging then why are restaurant takeaways not allowed?  Prevention is better than cure, i rinse and wipe EVERYTHING at home before storing. i'm still going to sanitize all food packages and throw away the plastic used to carry all that grocery... WHO did once mention there is no evidence of human2human transmission, look at us now 🤷🏽‍♂️_Counta  This is said. That's not even R500. Not all basic foods are covered there So what about those people who resistsLike when you distance yourself from them they keep following you. I was queuing for shoprite money market when i told some people to keep distance from me and they refused. What should we do about people like that. Only us can save lifes.  I would just let them go in front if I were you. Beautiful slides presentation, continue forward 😊😊👌👌 To which you add choose items that promote health not sickness. So stop  with the sugar, flour, vegetable oils and rice. Why are the police demanding Permits when we want to buy groceries? Just tell people to disinfect everything dude! Even groceries Khabazela! Siyabonga.  Be strong as as always! Its hard lot of ppl in one shop get together no distance Dear minister thank you for amazing work. My question is do I need a permit to go buy food essentials? Minister you gotta restrct this grocery thing bcz ppl are buying evryday.... What have you guys done to minimize the street beggars that are wondering the streets of South Africa? We are not safe anymore when we go out and get some essentials. Around Ghandi square, please help us. Thank you in advance Well, would be safe if I didn't have to drive 50 minutes to go and try to buy cigarettes!! Thank you we will try our best Excellent When I read the heading I thought it was a protection guide from SANDF, SAPS &amp; Metro Cops on the kasi streets Thank you so much Minister, we must abide with the rules so that we can flatten the curve. Surely then all food should be available to be sold?  I have a question. Yesterday someone with a mask was sneezing at the shop and l had one too. What are the chances of contracting the virus is at all she was infected doc? But it said the virus can survive on plastic and paper surfaces for up to 2 to 3 days sir.  Do i need a permit to be able to get essentials ? Atleast you are able to monitor. Mine are in rural areas in Limpopo. They left their books behind and are seriously impacted now. For them it's a long holiday. I wish I could be given permission to travel and help them login to their portals. My mother is old. I place paper on the table. All packets are placed on the paper. I wipe down or spray each and every item purchased, especially fridge items. Rather be safe than sorry. Wash hands thoroughly after. But retailers are still not allowed to sell cooked food during lock down? Of course not. CoronaHoax if it can be found on an object surface, what can stop it to be found on food packaging? my minister say""there are no cases confirmed from food packaging"" from the cases that are currently confirmed is there a method to test where,how and when they have occurred? Hello Dr Why can't we all get tested because it dsnt get better I'm not sure of this news about 24 Dis-chem  workers I'm so scared at the moment how many customers has this virus who was at that Dis-chem How long is covid 19 going to last in SA Retail staff and merchies are not social distancing- they always standing together in the aisles, chatting, sharing phone screens etc. Very worrying. Gauteng needs total shutdown Please instruct retailers to issue their staff with face masks. We cannot stay 1m away from cashiers when paying! Dr, according to you, the inevitable outcome for us all is testing positive for COVID-19, this means even if I test negative today I can still get it tomorrow, so how do we trust your fellow colleagues who will apparently be testing us? With Pick N Pay you can order online and they deliver at  your doorstep. That’s how I’ve been shopping OpenSA is the key to helping more people Thank u Minister we will do our best. I also sanitize everything I buy from the grocery shop my kids call me paranoid, maybe i am🤷🏽‍♀️ People should also learn to touh items they actualy plan on taking/buying. Rather  shop_with_your_eyes Must you also wash your clothes when returning from shops? I read this somewhere. Haven't done it though.  I wish I can be part of grocery shopper 🛒 but hey we did not get paid our March salaries by  I don't even have electricity, Food and other basic essentials PaySAExpressStaff PravinGordhan   _ZA  _mboweni   And the most important thing is to wear a mask. Because any customer or cashier could be an asymptomatic carrier. You've got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth.

" STOP GIVING IN TO MUSLIM'S.Well KFC has offended me by bending over. U.S. making same mistakes that Europe has.Give 1'',they take 1 mile  Hahaha KFC in for a huge shock when they ban KFC altogether not just the wipes...  Go to Chick fil a instead, we need to stop changing our way of life to appease everyone with a quirk.  Let them lick their left hands then.  good heavens-what a bunch of freaks. Congrats on your 250★ tweet!   Is this in the UK? If this shit comes to US I will NEVER eat  again.  KFC is most likely only a Subsidiary Franchise when ye consider ruling factors of th %s.    Fortunately Tweeting seems to be turning the tide.  Because KFC know their UK market. KFC is a business.  Bye bye Ms. American pie...  go to chik-filet .. popeyes, churches, or a local deli of some type, probably better anyway!  If only!  That's already happening in Australia there's hahal only Browns Chickens too bc they BUY them &amp; then they have somewhere to patronize. If you sell food in Birmingham &amp; it's not Halal. You sell less food. Demand side economics. Profit motive  some ignorant PC lefty decision. Obviously made by someone who doesn't understand Islam or Muslims. immigration is good but you emigrate to live a different life and simulate the culture of the land and laws.  Why are there Islam-controlled UK Cities?  then the Muslims go home and drink in private hypocrites to the max   Islam bans drinking alcohol, do KFC provide wipes to suck on? this is a joke, right? this stupidity has got to stop  Don't use a wipe - use a muslim? Or have I read this wrong? :-) Which customers do they need the most,Muslims or everyone else that has been their customers for decades &amp; never burned one. this isn't true, FYI. In case anyone is still interested in what's factual. Agree. UK stop the EVIL religion &amp; government via Islam &amp; Sharialaw. poor ole colonel is no doubt rolling in his grave   BAN KFC AND CANCEL PASSPORTS OF ALL BRITISHERS WHO DO NOT BOOZE  no more KFC!  Place is garbage food anyhow  _UKI &lt;&lt; See what you have done. Not listening to customers breaks balls. Getting it yet?.  Easily the stupidest story I've read in awhile. Ppl are clueless. Alcohol is essential for disinfection. FFS  satire?  Or are ukip Just thick? Eat mor Chickin @ ChicFilA!!  No keep going and maby you get behead. So go support them  No more Kenfucky fried chicken for me! I eat American only. Not some muslim hugging chicken.   Strange!  I'm a nurse &amp; never once did a Muslim patient ask me not to use an alcohol wipe before an injection. ""I AM ISRAEL"" Simplified!  disagree? see  &amp; &gt; … …  negative. Then we lose ground. We fight and take back whats ours. Either they abide by our rules or they can leave.  its all so utterly petty! Drives me insane! Just their way of pushing sharia shit! Lol re elbows ;) False   Economic counter jihad is needed:  What are u kidding me they really did that? KFC :( Wish I hadn't spent my money at your place today.!  They are too sensitive &amp; that's a fact, where's their tolerance?I don't eat their originally secret too damn greasy chicken     It means there is a market.Shows you how many are there.  _Wirral  KFC halal branches listed here Rest are non-halalWHY NO LABELS And SubWay 200 stores have taken pork prducts off of Menur Ban chicken next?    Thursdayhello  Tell the Muslims to stop eating the darned wipes! they'll be stoping our supermarkets supplying pork next because it offends them  what a fucking joke, the Colonel would be turning in his grave, if they don't like it, piss off   Why do we keep pandering to these people? R U kidding me????They sure have a lot of clout here.  the ban islam crap is a bit much...the hand wipes are equally a bit much   what?  That is retarded Ukip is basically just made up of former Tories... Nothing changes but the name  Have we all gone mad? I don't eat the stuff anyway, its chickens have elbows!  some people need to get a fucking reality check   Customers should ask and refuse Halal . Kill them economically .  I thought Muslims don't eat pork? whats with the wipes? I like there biscuits....  Pass the damn bacon!!  If the Muslims are idiotic enough to suck on the wipes, it's THEIR problem, not KFC's.  well said And how come they are NEVER offended by the benefits they claim from us infidels.  ---&gt;  &lt;---- CAN Suck It! Ban muslims if they don't like what we have, WELL they can just move back to the hell hole they came from! R Shut up!  That seems very extreme. Diverse cultures have an option to partake or abstain..if U disagree- don't use them. People who eat in KFC's are the sort of people who make love to vacuum cleaners.     read the article properly,it was a member of staff..read American style chicken offends me...  Has to be British or is like sponsoring terrorists  HAVE YOU NOTICED THE LACK OF SKIN ON CHICKEN PORTIONS IN YOUR LOCAL SMKT.?  FFS, the KFCs in Mid East give out wet wipes (in my limited experience of Mid East KFCs). UK gone mad  Priv. corp so not a big deal in my mind. They need to accommodate the market share they want.  Check out Chick-fil-A must better than KFC What's next? A Burqa for The Colonel? No female employees? Why not tofu chicken so as not to offend PETA?   - yes! Stamp it out now or it really will be too late. It's a terrible story, it really is. I never saw animal rights activists protest Halal - the most cruel method to kill animals/birds for meat  Dumb question:  Why do Muslims hate alcohol?  ban it in hospitals too, horrible stuff, tried all sorts of mixers with it too  the religion of Islam sucks. so does Christianity and Mormonism  there's alcohol in them ? They give them away free. result  Demand Bacon at KFC!    freemarineA Kentucky Fried Cr*p! fed up of having other religions rammed down my throat if I wanted to be a Muslim I would become one. KFC off my list then cheers  I am an American offended by Obama  Just how ridiculous can we get! This all pisses me off.  Tell them to go home if they don't like how we live.  (I'm vegie anyhow )  Erm... I think Islamic world pioneered use of alcohol for medical purposes. It's consumption that's forbidden.   You guys are turning into France. Wipes are not required to be used, are they? Smile, tell the fussies where the dry napkins are, and Who can I help next?  the once great British empire will be dirt roads and mud huts in a hundred years, if not sooner.  It's not consumable alcohol? ie Ethanol. What's next screenwash?  That's right Patriot. We need to let the Corporates who really is in charge in America; that being We the American People.  A Muslim leader said banning of wipes was bizarre and KFC have apologised so no need to stop visiting. KFC is disgusting anyway.  That's the main reason to ban them.  dafuq? They don't even know the diff between rubbing alcohol and drinking alcohol? RL Idiocracy. What kind of drivel is this you're spouting?  There he boycotted alcohol wipes zibidi get deported! not aware of that religion from the   Thats exactly why the problem exists because people have, I for one have had enough. When in Rome  stupid If an alcohol wipe offends then I guess they should just use their shit covered hands to eat the halal crap.  It already is, when the likes of Anjem Chowdry freely roam the streets of Londonistan!   why boycott them over a staff members mistake? Not policy?  you need the wipes for greasy chicken.  (a) It was a halal KFC (think kosher), targeted to Muslim customers, not a regular KFC; (b) it was staff error  Isn't it rubbing alcohol?  The stuff that'll make you go blind you if you drink it?  Wow!!! They didn't tell them that the chicken is cooked in pig lard???? LMAO   Never use the place so won't get rich on me!!!freemarineA😄😄!  I'll overlook it as long as they come through with those Kentucky fried pork rinds they've been planning.    had FREE  food at the KC on Saturday, avoided that Hal Al shite! This is stupid though. Muslims just can't consume alcohol, there's nothing wrong with hand wipes containing alcohol!?"	1
Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. 🐾 *Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?*Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times.Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.🐶 *Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?*There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.	0

Is COVID-19 airborne?❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.

@_sh4 NY/NJ/CT continue to trend down in daily new cases even as many other states have either stopped their downward trend or inflected upward since the mass protests started. Estimates of prevalence are 20-25%, well below the herd immunity threshold. So what is going on?@_sh4 ... is an issue, but I am not sure the situation warrants the kind of hopelessness and unpredictability conveyed here. To paraphrase Jonathan Haidt, this is the coddled American mind... The preamble of political opinions about masks, etc. makes me wonder if the hopelessness, as you point out, is intended to make a political point. It seems like a tactic to scare ppl into wearing masks.@_sh4 Yeah those were the elements that made me think that. BTW speaking of your contempt for epidemiologists there is something very interesting going on that they need to get into the bottom off ...@_sh4 It is not just mask compliance. I have noticed in NJ increasing socialization and crowding in public places as the state has reopened. Yet we don't detect a pickup in cases. Could it be that herd immunity can be reached at lower levels than thought or perhaps seroprevalence ...@_sh4 ... estimates are missing true infection attack rates? It is quite puzzling but I see no attempts to engage with it by epidemiologists.	0
" What is wrong with this guy?  We have PLENTY of testing.  So much testing that sites shut down from lack of demand.  The goalposts constantly shift for Team Apocalypse.  No amount of testing, serology testing, contact tracing, ANYTHING will satisfy their desire for ""safety.""No. A just government protects our rights. You want a mommy to care for you. America was founded by men who wanted to live free.   And the stupid thing about testing is that if a person is found not to have the virus that day, he could get it the next, so it's pretty pointless.  Their retort to that would be,  ""Well then we need even more testing.  Serology testing.  No reopening until we have a vaccine.  Two more weeks until the healthcare system collapses!""  There's just no reasoning with them, which makes this all the more frustrating."	0

But there is no responsible government that takes away these dangerous people is deadly dangerous! Misleading information Where do I get my package gafana, kiu Even if you hate sonko it's you and you alone , sonko anapendwa, ballot bado atashinda Please tell  that alcohol when ingested acts primarily at the CNS level and hence his objective of dealing with coronavirus through issuance of alcoholic drink  is cosmetic. Hii mask yake ni gani? Is this really necessary? You can put that cost into a better use. Alcohol is a luxury at this point in time. Drunken master life is good and funny sometimes..na hiyo mask yote  kwa kichwa spitting nonsense later ajipate akiwa na covid19.... 😂😂😂sonko  is right alcohol suppreses virus when used above 60% in  hand sanitizer but when taken   ametupa mbao  na  randa Moderate alcohol consumption reduces your risks of developing and dying of heart disease which if you get Corona you'll die so the Sonko is right Am ashamed to have voted you in.

Myths about the Corona Virus1. Taking ice cream and other cold foods do not facilitate or aid the onset of the disease.2. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease.3. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted via mosquito bites. 4. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.5. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.5. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever.This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.6. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces,but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.7. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.8. To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.	0

"_Ego1488   My question is why do we need to have a desert cult faith anyway? Regardless of anything Jesus may have said or done, why do we need it? Why not use our own religion that we've used since our beginning? I didn't vote in 2016.  Trump has a fanatical fan base of Judeo-Christians.  What can you do in a Nation where over 80% of boys are circumcised as infants because...""muh Bible says so duuude""   (1) Jesus forbid circumcision even if he was circumcised against his will.It's the Protestants who reintroduced it because they follow Judaïsm and not Catholicism which by the way was 100% anti Judaïsm until the free-masons infiltrated it and changed it from the inside during  (2) the renaissance.The Americans are the most stupid and evil people on earth, nothings to do with religions, they are the sewer of Europe, the worst of the worst, convicts, rapists, murderers, crooks, etc  (3) Europe didn't want them and unfortunately didn't exterminate them, instead they sended them to the new world (new Jerusalem) and since then they fuck up the world even more than the Jews.  (4) I'm not Christian but Jesus hated the Jews, that's why they had him killed, Christianism is a poison yes but Jesus was not part of it, he was a Jew who hated his own race like so many more Jews...   We don't need to have a desert cult faith, i never said that, we only need to get rid of (((them))) once and for all and Varg is right but the problem is even without Christianism, the Jews will still control us, they are everywhere, not just in Christianism"	0

 _Boylan Well then why do we need it.. Doesn't the average router in everyone's house carry a frequency of 2.5 and 5ghz.? Say it did increase to 60ghz or even 300ghz, what would be the effects of it on people and animals?The 5G conspiracy muppets who were responsible for this damage should see serious jail time and not only for criminal damage but also just for being unintelligent, delusional arseholes. When will these anti-everything, tin-foil-hat wearing clowns wake up?  _Boylan 5G has been proven as being a health risk to people, especially those with weak immune systems.. it will also remove your privacy and freedom, do your research, that's what you're good at Niall. Don't fall into the narrative trap. Help spread the truth _Boylan No it hasn't there is no proof regarding 5G _Boylan You are absolutely correct.. there is no proof its dangerous or safe. The lack of safety testing concerns me.. I know we all have mobile phones, wifi routers, microwaves and several other devices that transmit some kind of radio waves but 5G is at least 10 times the strength. _Boylan And is a radio signal which can do absolutely no harm to you _Boylan Can you back that up _Boylan Yes I can considering I work in the field myself _Boylan Do you.. so is it true they operate at 60ghz and above. The same frequency as a military ray gun _Boylan No thats a myth we have no where that came from. 5G can carry a frequency up to 300ghz but the frequency range that will be used for 5G will be between 3.3ghz and 4.2ghz _Boylan Let me put it another way i am assuming you have WiFi at home. And during this lockdown have you noticed it being a bit slower than normal that's due to the volume of people logging on which in turns makes it slower. 5G removes that _Boylan I understand that the wifi is slower at the moment and if everything goes back to normal, it will return to normal. The 4G on my network hasn't really changed.. I also don't believe that 5G is Covid. It is just coincidental that this is happening at the same time. _Boylan 4G runs around 2.8 ghz while I do agree why do we need it now we do need it in the future because of the improvement in speed and download time.	0

"  Right. But individual responsibility requires individual responsibility. These idiots are advocating football games, going to the beach, and movie theaters. They believe COVID-19 is ""just like the flu"" and refuse to take responsibility for their thinking or actions.The president uses vague calls to action so he can avoid responsibility and later claim he meant something else. Just yesterday, he was outlining a phased approach for “opening up America again.” He should be specific about his concerns. Which measures are okay and which are not?  How about just an emphasis on individual responsibility again?  It’s ok to educate on wearing gloves and masks and staying inside without enforcing it as law.   True. But it's hard to trust people to not go if the idiots keep swarming toward them.The whole thing about freedom is it comes with responsibility.A society filled with people who are incapable of exercising freedom without hurting others is a doomed society."	1

Hello Mr.Governor I believe you should visit computer village, malls, lagos &amp; yaba markets.Then give another statement.The Church does not &amp; will never cause increase of any disease.As for the mask - this is what your WHO has to say.  3. Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 4.

I didn't just pick that out of the air to say it there's a map showing where all the cases are.. I don't care if people go back to work I just don't want the people where I live to get sick because ppl come here.  _jaycee Again, what is covid 19?  At this point seemingly the flu. Recent antibody tests in Miami Dade alone indicate such.  Not to mention the studies in Santa Clara and new York.  It's time we see we've been fooled. There’s a self sorting going on, and no government can stop it...Those who wish to remain quarantined are, those choosing normal life over the risks are...It’s immoral and destructive to keep things locked down when there is no fear of a health care system... _jaycee As long as you return to your beaches in your state and stay out of my state will be good with the beaches.Look at the I-10 corridor from Texas to Florida and you can see where the spring breakers and vacationers came through in February that whole corridor is contaminated.  _jaycee Contaminated. But with what?  A cold?  A flu?  Some new thing that 99.5 percent of humans can and do fight off with white blood cells alone, not even needing otc meds.   Get real.   Let's get back to work and life.  _jaycee That whole I-10 corridor is contaminated with covid-19. I didn't just pick that out of the air to say it there's a map showing where all the cases are.. I don't care if people go back to work I just don't want the people where I live to get sick because ppl come here.  _jaycee Just wanting you stop being scared.  We know it's nothing to be afraid of unless you choose to be.  Recent antibody tests show that it has a very low fatality rate and has likely been here since late 2019. You may choose fear if you wish.   _jaycee I'm  not afraid for myself. It's  the ppl in my community  I want kept safe. When vacationers come here and they've got 20 in a room and the restaurants same then a service station movies.  Who you think's going to get sick the people that live here. I care for my community.  _jaycee Also, personal digs and insults are not the way to counter paths of logic and data.

_Marciniak Now, I understand that the dose of HCQ used in the recovery trial was based on the IC50 in vitro.  But what about the toxicity and safety?   Here is another PK modeling paper of HCQ and my thoughts on it. Actually, long QT risk related to plasma concentration. RECOVERY trial loading regime designed to reach the IC50 for SARS-CoV-2 from in vitro studies rapidly, but chronic HCQ treatment for, say, rheumatoid reaches these concentrations but much more slowly. Admittedly, the [HCQ] reached is at upper end of what used for RhA, but within that range. Paper not out but last weekend owing to the WHO recommended pause, a safety analysis was reported to show no toxicity signal. Note, patient screening for RECOVERY took into account QTc so higher risk people excluded._Marciniak There are two studies showing that more than 10% of covid19 patients developed QT prolongations&gt;50ms even under the regular dosing regimen. _Marciniak 	0

I. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.D. How can I protect myself You can protect yourself by:-  Washing your hands with soap and running water frequently : before and after eating, after using toilet, touching animals or animal waste- Covering mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing- Avoiding close contact with anyone who shows symptoms.- Seek medical care if you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing.Trending CoronavirusOutbreak- Have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care- Do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick- Are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected CoronaVirus InfectionG. How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask •Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.•Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.•Avoid touching the mask while using it;•Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use is advised.H. Does the new coronavirus affect older peoplePeople of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virusHowever, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.J. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support.The goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.	0
 Is this evidence that herd immunity is ultimately needed? If you have a series of lockdowns followed by a series of new peaks - what is the point of lockdown?for countries like Bulgaria that locked down incredibly early, prevented much of a spread at all and then reopened, the renewed spike puts them in an awkward position.   Unfortunately untrue: if you do herd immunity it’s going to get out of control within an instant which will overwhelm the ICU units especially in a country like America which only has a healthcare system for the rich. Even Germany was on the brink of exhaustion in NRW region  Not in the UK with our expanded capacity	0
Can eating garlic help prevent the virus?Garlic does have antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from outbreak that garlic has protected people from the virus.Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?common questions about covid-19 Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?UV lamps shouldn’t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause cell deaths. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever because of infection with the virus.They can’t detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. Due to it taking between 2-10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the virus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the virus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.Can rinsing your nose with saline help prevent the virus?No. There is no evidence that rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from the virus. There is some limited evidence that rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold.People of all ages can be infected by covid-19. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.

  But what is herd immunity is much easier to attain than expected? This virus doesn’t grow exponentially.  don't put words in my mouthI m concerned about the public health aspects first, economy second (like 70% of America, btw, data available by request). here in CT we shut down, got control, and like most in the northeast are opening slowly and with cautions like masks built in  this is what I want  what I see coming from you (and friends) is economy &gt; public health and so to get there, and justify that order of importance (since 120K have died), the virus is downplayed.younger infection is goodherd immunity is the way to goetcPublic health docs don't agree  in my view, the way to help the economy is to get control of the virus, not vice versaand so 'you just want to close the economy' is false. It's a partisan charge.I want to control the virus to open the economyVaccine is the power tool in the toolbox Not the only tool. /fin  it grows exponentially. That's what's happening in AZ right now before your eyes.It would be GREAT if herd if immunity was real and easy to achieve. That takes ~70% of the population assuming we're immune after infection (unproven, it's not true for other coronaviruses). But..	0

"Q: Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?A: No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The 2019-nC0V is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should  not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.   _Europe    Q: Does the new coronavirus (2019-nC0V) affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?A: People of all ages can be infected by the virus.Older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus   _Europe    Q: Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?A: At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs, cats can be infected with the virus.However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets   _Europe    Q: Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?A: To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the virus.WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range of partners.   _Europe    Q: Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against 2019nCoV?A: No. Vaccines against pneumonia do not provide protection against 2019-nCoV.The virus is new and different.

I'm not a medical professional but I would want to share I little I have learnt about Coronavirus and COVID19What is a Coronavirus?A coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely, can be transmitted from animals to humans and then spread person to person.There are 3 currently identified coronaviruses1.The MERS virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.2. The SARS virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the Guangdong province in southern China3. The COVID19 or the WuhanCoronovirusCOVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. It takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms may include:1.fever Anyone with a measured temperature of at least 100.4 °F [38 °C]) 2. Cough3. Shortness of breathThere is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Symptoms of a coronavirus usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor to prescribe pain or fever medication.As with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest.	0

HOW DOES COVID-19 SPREAD?🤧 People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 💦 The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.🥄 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. 👈 Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. ↔️ People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 whocoughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHOWhatsapp	0

How can we realistically expect a vaccine for covid19, when we have a govt in power lacking ability, accountability, integrity, and honor, installed to deliver a fraudulent brexit result, won on lies? vaccine will come..but obviously not from our govt..will come from a country that gives a damn... 16 years on we still have no vaccine for SARS, a respiratory flu reportedly with similar symptoms as Covid. It will indeed be a Christmas miracle if a vaccine for Covid magically appears soon!  It's not the full story. Vaccines are only found when  it looks like there will be a financial rewarded at the end of the process. It the disease recedes all attempts at a vaccine get stopped. it doesn' mean a vaccine could not be found; they just stop looking. _dan I realistically expect a placebo to be pushed as a vaccine. _dan I have been thinking about this vaccine thing, if its developed in the UK,  how long will it take big companies to take it over and charge a fortune for it. Half the elite Tories and cohorts will be rubbing their hands because they probably have invested in it. DICTATORSHIP 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❎👍👷😀 I have no doubt that they will come up with a miracle vaccine (or, in Tory circles, known by its true name of placebo) just to get more of us out, full of confidence that we are immune, spreading the virus to our vulnerable and elderly.I really would not be surprised by this!	0

  You need to also consider that may are not tested due to widespread test shortage and the ~80% accuracy of the results. The M.E. is the one that lists cause of death on the death cert. and they are about 8 weeks behind. The numbers are certainly much higher than can be reported.  If you cannot test accurately, you cannot get derive any numbers with accuracy that are predicated on positive results. The numbers are high, and even now the majority of people are distancing. Death count is not very important. Long term health problems are very important.  BTW - We are not testing for asymptomatic. We do not have enough test except for the serious suspects and those awaiting surgeries/procedures.  You don't die from any virus. You die from problems that resulted from contracting the virus and effects on the systems of the body. Example: Acute MyocarditisYou don't die from a Motor Vehicle Accident. You die from the result of the MVA. Example: Hypovolemic Shock	0

Part 3What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. FREDIBOATPart 5Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.FREDIBOATPart 6How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. FREDIBOATPart 7These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19Part 8who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    FREDIBOATPart 9Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”Part 10Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, FREDIBOATPart 11many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  FREDIBOATPart 12WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    FREDIBOATPart 13Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this FREDIBOATPart 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. FREDIBOATPart 15Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eatingFREDIBOATPart 16What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. FREDIBOATPart 17Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularlyFREDIBOATfor the latest news.Part 18You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with FREDIBOATPart 19droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many FREDIBOATPart 20surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. FREDIBOATPart 21This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such asPart 22cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will FREDIBOATPart 23have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.FREDIBOATPart 24Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? FREDIBOATPart 25You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.**********Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for FREDIBOATPart 26everyone)Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or FREDIBOATPart 27to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 FREDIBOATPart 28Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.FREDIBOATPart 29How likely am I to catch COVID-19?The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places aroundPart 30the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure toPart 31comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in FREDIBOATPart 32China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.

Q: What can I do to protect myself from COVID19?A: Practice good hygiene: ✅ WASH YOUR HANDS✅ cover coughs/sneezes with tissue/elbow—not your hands✅ don't touch eyes/nose/mouth✅ clean surfaces often✅ stay home when sick✅ avoid sick peopleℹ️   How does avoiding sick people help during the 20+ day asymptomatic transmission period?  If you want ppl to stay home when they're sick, you need to mandate paid sick time to all part and full time workers in the state. When most of us live paycheck to paycheck staying home isn't an option.	0

How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with ++COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.For more information, please contact us. ✨E-mail: info.combgghealthcare health healthy healthylifestyle healthcare coronavirus Coronaturkey COVID19	0
_realist    _krammer  Look at you wearing your mask in appropriate situations!  Well done.  Now if you can get your fellow GOPers to do the same maybe we can start to get out of this mess: _realist    _krammer  Deaths are making a comeback and may follow these recent hospitalizations.  Hopefully not.  Herd immunity is not a goal. 40% of SARS survivors still getting treatment 5 years later. We don't even know if immunity is a thing._realist    _krammer  The goal is to stomp out the virus. Come on. The goal isn't to infect billions of people around the globe.  You want to talk draining our savings? Herd immunity is almost always used to model what percentage of a population needs to be vaccinated to prevent virus spread.	0

We'll see. Didnt we just get a Jobs biopic? this is just a terrible idea. they're making another one. They're making ANOTHER Steve Jobs movie? I think it's a little too early for a reboot. Seth will pull it off nicely I thought they would hire an actual actor for that instead of Seth Rogen. The guy plays himself in everything.	0

Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease. Normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. CoronaVirusUpdates There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. CoronaVirusUpdates Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. CoronaVirusUpdates People of all ages can be infected by the new COVID19. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.  CoronaVirusUpdates Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.COVID19 is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.If hospitalized for COVID19, you may receive antibiotics coz bacterial co-infection is possible CoronaVirusUpdates To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat covid19However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.

  Question- How come you never had a problem with this in the Sun/Moon series? They didn't have National Dex then, or the game before it. Why do we need it now, especially when we have Pokemon Home?The Galar region is yours to explore!All our PokemonSwordShield guides—covering Shiny Pokémon hunting, Max Raid Battles, and more—are now in one location.Tag a friend who might find this useful during their first journey through the Galar region!➡️   Every Pokémon, no matter shape, size, or colour, is loved by somebody. That’s why it’s so important to continue supporting each and every one in the newest games. Thanks for bringing back an additional 200, but there are still ~250 still excluded. BringBackNationalDex please.   Because all Pokémon were coded into those games. Now we have Pokémon we can only stare at and see how useless they are in an app.   Yeah but moving those Pokemon to the new games is still pretty useless. I think keeping these restrictions opens up more opportunities for Competitive pokemon, so that players have to get more creative instead of just transfering old teams. Plus... They're coming in the DLC.	0

Droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing.As of today, 169,906 Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in 6,644 fatalities worldwide. After its discovery last December, in Wuhan, China, the virus started to spread around the world, causing panic.How do the seven humancoronaviruses differ?The main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. The first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while Sars and Mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity.How do viruses work?A virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. It enters the cell through binding with receptors and “reprogrammes it” to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body.The virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. Washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection.There are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. But this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty.How deadly is the new coronavirus compared to Sars, Mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold?We cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed.Also, with Covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since Covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal.It is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. Compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for Sars-Cov-2 is higher.Although compared to Sars (9.6 per cent) and Mers (34.4 per cent), Covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger.Can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus?For some respiratory viruses this does happen. Not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. In this case, it is still premature to say.	0

_mueller Tabitha, when do you think we can realistically expect reliable election results? I know that The Indy is doing live coverage and will also have a website where we keep track and call the races, so that would be a good resource too -- sorry, for some reason twitter didn't send this final tweet (clearly social media and I are not exactly BFFs)_mueller Excellent, thank you! It will depend on the race and how close the races are -- for wide margins it'll be easier to have a better idea. Initial results should start coming in around 8:30 and will continue to be published until 12 on Election day. Everything is unofficial until June 19. 8:30 p.m. to midnight -- sorry, twitter's character limit sometimes irks me I know that the Indy is planning some live coverage so I would recommend following along with that on Election night. Let me know if you have more questions!	0

When this pandemic infected 26 of the population worldwide, it made me fear for my life. But now? It infected more than a hundred thousands of people, millions of people to be exact. What is “COVID-19” anyway? It is a crisis that we all should take seriously. This pandemic, I became productive. I learned how to decipher codes, I get to watch a lot of animes and read many books. I am happy because I get to spend more time with my family like, watching movies, eating together and talked and talked about everything.This pandemic started and the true face of the people also started to unmask. Some families doesn’t have a proper home, some doesn’t have the stable job to provide the need for their family, and some doesn’t have the privilege to protect themselves during this pandemic.What about them? There are people that are hoarding the necessities, to what? To benefit you from preventing the virus? To re-sell it at a higher price? These people didn’t even think about the people who doesn’t have enough money to buy enough necessities for their family. To be honest, I got mad at them. During this pandemic, I also realized how bad our government is. The president didn’t even bother to tell us the plan at an early time, instead he ordered the police and soldiers to kill everyone not obeying the rules. I mean????? The people not obeying the rules are hungry, they are waiting for the relief goods that was supposed to be distributed as soon as possible but nothing was distributed. I also realized that no matter how bad and irresponsible you are, if you have a position at the government and if you are rich, you can wander freely everywhere, spreading the virus and still be given compassion that you don’t deserve. This pandemic made me aware of the issues of what’s really happening. It angers me a lot, to be honest because if you don’t have the privilege, you are going to be ignored like a pest. That’s how dirty the government works.We already have the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia with minimal testing. Without testing, we’re acting blind &amp; exposing the vulnerable— old, poor, and the jobless. I think that there will be no choice but to extend this lockdown. We should all cooperate during this lockdown. The government should provide our needs and necessities to prevent people from going outside. We can overcome this situation by cooperating and puting our faith to God and the frontliners. We also should give our biggest salute to our frontliners, not only they are giving their absolute best, but they are staking their lives as well. REINE ELYSSA G. FODRA STEM 11-03	0

   _vogel     What is it for normal flu? Guessing it's pretty high. Given the extremely low average mortality rate for COVID-19 I'd expect the NNT to be over 10,000, maybe much higher once herd immunity is reached worldwide. Residual panic will no doubt help with sales.   _vogel     Agree Meredith. But when herd immunity takes over, it will have fewer hosts. My belief is that immunity from a real infection is greater than that achieved from a vaccine. COVID is so contagious that herd will occur prior to a vaccine.	0

Nat'l Geo TV has operated with that exact content for years.  just irrelevant.   maybe not, but is a cover story than opens w praying to the Virgin Mary cures cancer any better? wake me up  Damn. Can the just discovered remains of Bat Boy be far behind?  R U kidding me??? It was a decent magazine before   took over! The man ruins everything he touches :(Not dumbing down (yet) - Nat Geo ""Strange But True"" is one of many special issues.     I'm very depressed now.  it's fake  That was a special edition from maybe just over a year ago. Nothing to do with Murdoch.   did no such thing. Fox didn't take ownership till mid-Nov, post-layoffs.  Can you cancel a subscription?    Always sad to see someone I respect retweeting without stopping to consider the veracity of the tweet. Disgusting. An insult to  Academia and Nature.   oh dear. National Geographic is now dead to me...   I had no idea Murdoch owns that now.  :(. As pointed out by many, NatGeo has a supernatural special issue every year. This is it. It's shelved with ""Specials.""  HOW IS THIS NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MATERIAL?! No it didn't. That cover appeared in 2014 and was a special issue for non-subscribers. time for another boycott  ...I'm in the know 😉 hahahahahaha funny but sad.  it's a special edition and nobody is sure if this came out before or after Murdoch bought the magazine. Well, mixed reviews on the pseudoscience of supernatural in this copy. 😢 don't get it  WHAT?!This has nothing to do with Murdoch and you know it. I can't stand the man either.   I would offer that it had been a crappy magazine well before the sale.    Commissioned before the Murdoch takeover, I believe.  Uhm, that is just a special edition.  I'm honestly more interested in that ""Sandwich 06"" on the shelf below. Is that a weird spin-off on Sonic 06?  no, say it isn't so ... NatGeo turning supermarket tabloid??? Oh, the humanity ...  RIP National Geographic - Sadly will now never purchase again due to ownership Sorry, no The answer is 42 😬  this is a ""special issue"" that was out prior to the acquisition  well you don't want people documenting the beauty of the natural world. Might stop its destruction for profit.  Has he merged it with the ForteanTimes?  reminds me of when respected publisher Time-Life covered paranormal stuff in a book series   Any sultry, pouting, topless Page 3 GEO Girls?"	1

Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?No. Antibiotics dont work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatmentProtection measures for everyone. * Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. * Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.* Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. * Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.*Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.Should I wear a mask to protect myself? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

What is Haseltine talking about? This is simply wrong. The common cold coronaviruses confer immunity for several months to several years, about 2 years on average. Seems to also completely confuse the concept of herd immunity with just immunity. WTFDifficult to see this as anything but alarmism and sensationalism. We are ~7 months into this pandemic with all eyes on this virus, and there is still not a single example of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection reported.	0

  _NP2013 If you don't like the term herd immunity why did you use it?And what is burnout in this context? If you'd like to share info, I'd prefer a source over a twitter account so I don't need to try to sift through a bunch of their info to find whatever it was you hoped to share. Thx.  It would be cool if that were true or if we even knew it were possible.  We don't know if or for how long getting the virus gives an individual immunity for. There have been people getting the virus twice. The science on this is presumed but isn't in yet.COVID-19 cases threaten our economy and our ability to ensure hospital care to people who need it. Everyone should wear a mask to protect those around you, practice physical distancing, stay home if they're sick, and wash their hands regularly. 	0

Will it protect me from getting COVID-19? JCIAUKickoutCovid19           COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets from person-to-person contact or through touching surfaces that have viral particles on them and then touching your face or mouth.  JCIAUKickoutCovid19 _nigeria            COVID-19 can live on surfaces for a variety of different times so that’s why it’s so important to do frequent handwashing for at least 20seconds and disinfecting surfaces with Cleaning products that are known to kill the virus.  JCIAUKickoutCovid19 _nigeria            Social distancing and physical separation by at least 6 feet or 1 meter is vital to making sure that we limit viral spread.

  Red..you are better than this... so how is Obama responsible for mass shootings when he has tried multiple times to put gun laws in place? two statistics that have nothing to do with eachother lol  this is so besides the point of what happen...the bigger picture is being missed. bush - 9/11. END DISCUSSION. bollocks to this figure. ...355 mass shootings in the US this year So it must be Obama's fault. Genius deduction Columbo. this is by far the stupidest tweet ever. Oh my... the USA= all of them yeah because there couldn't possibly be any other factors involved than the president.  That's sarcasm by the way. its worse than that I'm afraid. There has actually been 355 mass shootings in 2015 alone. worse, most irrelevant statistic on Twitter today. This may be true, but  will just say it's Bush Jr's fault. He inherited the mess. noleadership WakeUpAmerica and this list means what?_86  both of those incidents under Obamas control. He is the great divider. Don't forget to add Bush invasion to Irak trigger ISIL.  wonder why it's higher with dem presidents? Anybody have a clue? amount of lives lost under W 9/11 attack?

4 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. A little introduction from Rhodes Island. 1 COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose. 3 Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. 5 You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

_dc  _reece  If that’s what it was truly about, what have these people done to protest the government spying on them? Do the 4th and 14th amendments mean nothing?

These reopen events are the result of an astroturfing campaign.The fact all the GUNMEN are WHITE and not being Detained While basically holding senators hostage scared for their lives, says everything! African Americans have been stopped at that building for having fingernail clippers. Trump commanded to “Liberate Michigan” ..now this Or this shows what a well armed militia can accomplish._reece  The key word is well-regulated. A bunch of white thugs trying to effect change through fear is not a well-regulated protest. Nor is protesting the lack of ability to go to a bar or a hair salon during a pandemic an exercise of freedom. It is narcissistic terrorism. _reece  It is exactly what freedom is.

_ Like other viruses it can spread via *aerosol not the same as airborne basically if someone coughs or something it can remain in the air for a given time but since they’re not living organisms they’ll eventually die because they don’t have a host to replicate their genome in 🦠_ CDC confirms it as droplet. Cough/sneeze into a tissue then throw it away, if you don’t have tissue you can sneeze into clothing like sleeves. educate anyone you see do otherwise, this is how it’s spread!_ Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth &amp; wash your hands often (droplets could still be on a surface you touch).	0

 Just for the record, see the WHO advice (under “is there anything I should NOT do?”):“*In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early* to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection...” (emphasis theirs) Or you sit at home, develop symptoms that need greater care, and die.The opposite of “don’t panic” is not “don’t go to the doctor”.It’s certainly not “book a cruise, because screw other people”. Yuh huh. And nobody’s saying go for a cough. I’m saying your “nothing they can do except in the most severe cases” advice is horseshit.Most severe means ICU. Plenty of people need medical care at much less extreme levels. Why do you assume you know better than the vast majority of the world’s public health experts?	0

This photo was taken by a tourist at the National War Memorial, shortly before Nathan Cirillo was shot and killed.  rest in peace brother   Arme fonctionelle mais les militaires n`ont pas de balles en leur possession.  According to the news, their weapons are not loaded. it isnt crime scene tape..its caution tape for some construction being done right behind them  totally agree! My love, thoughts, and prayers to the family and also to our nation as we grieve this tragedy. Where is Canada? How did we get to this place and where are going to go from here?  Watch the next brave soldier step up to take his place...  No, they are not loaded. I don't think they are even real. However, I may be mistaken on the latter.Le militaire tué serait à gauche MT :  photo taken by tourist at the War Memorial, shortly before shooting  it was taken before  the shooting the tape was there because there was construction going on.    They were repairing it  That is caution tape, not crime scene tape. There has been restoration work ongoing on the memorial  And a pity and tragedy it was.  horrific event, that a person felt justified to take this young mans life, is  sad and a terrible day globally. stopradicalization I don't think it's crime tape, I think it's caution tape because they were working on the memorial for Remembrance Day!

"    I think it's on CDC site too, but can't find it now.At WHOLook under ""How does Covid 19 spread"" then: ""Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?""Says:""The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low."" Second question. How many people got the virus, were asymptomatic the entire time, and never knew?These two questions make up a LOT of people.   Yes , but you can spread it to others who’s immune systems can’t handle it. Which is the whole point basically of staying home.    That's true, but according to the CDC it's very rare.  A person who is asymptomatic doesn't have an easy way to spread it."	0

" _Sorry  What is needed is a serology test but they aren't available yet. I can understand symptom testing in some cases but overall I believe it fails because of asymptomatic spread and people like us who may, may not have it.

THERE'S YOUR DEMAND!Sorry to say this, , but STFU! pmqs _Sorry  WTF? I have had mild symptoms for over a month that I cant get any kind of treatment for because it ‘might be’ covid, but can’t get a test. What is he on about??? _Sorry  Hey, can I support you on that. Me too. Odd stuff, cough, then gone, mild neuralgia then gone, not loss of smell, increased. Sudden increase in heart rate and short of breath. Then gone. Tired plus. Still mild occasional cough. Aches. etc.. Temperature up not high for 2 days. _Sorry  Yes mine is similar. Weird sounding cough but mostly just feeling short of breath. Its absolutely not a ‘persistent’ cough, just helps relieve the breathing. I feel like I have a sinus infection. Could be covid says the GP so cant prescribe anything, and so i go on suffering it. _Sorry  Hopefully! That would be helpful. Although if I could get the test many others have had atleast if it came back covid negative I could get treatment for the sinus infection Ive been bothered by for the last 5+ weeks 😂"	0

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 1/3Let´s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let´s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here´s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization.CovidfreeAprilCovidfreePhilippinesCovidfreeWorldWhat is a coronavirus?Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.What is COVID-19?COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

THREAD on COVID19 spread &amp; testing.How does COVID-19 spread?It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. Close contact, which is being closer than 6 feet for more than 10 minutes w/a sick individual, increases your risk of catching it. (1/12) COVID19US … individuals with severe illness from COVID-19 may need hospital care, which would still be supportive care of symptoms because there is no specific treatment for the disease… (5/12)COVID19US… Whether you are positive or negative, we ask that people stay home for 72 hours after their symptoms end to avoid passing illness to others… (6/12)COVID19US… If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to stay home for 7 days after your positive test OR for 72 hours after your symptoms end, whichever is LONGER… (7/12)COVID19US… This is different from flu, which has a specific antiviral medication that can be given if a flu test is positive. No specific treatment for COVID-19 = no different care after a positive test result. (8/12)COVID19USWho gets tested? How?Anyone with symptoms can go to a healthcare provider. If the provider decides a test is needed, they can collect specimens and request a test from the state lab or order one from a commercial lab… (9/12)COVID19US… Working with a provider is very important—a cough and fever can have many causes, so seeing a provider will help you get an answer about cause and treatment… (10/12)COVID19US… There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, so if your symptoms are from some other cause, it’s important that you’re working with a provider who can help you get well. (11/12)COVID19USStill have questions? Follow  or visit  (12/12)📷: My kid is/I am coughing. Should I ask for testing?Contact a healthcare provider if you or your child has symptoms such as cough, fever, or shortness of breath. Children typically have milder symptoms, more like a common cold… (2/12)COVID19US… Treatment will not change based on a positive COVID-19 test. Positive or negative, treatment will be fluids, fever-reducing medication, rest, or other supportive care for symptoms… (3/12)COVID19US… there is currently no treatment specific to COVID-19, so a positive test result only indicates the cause of illness, not any type of treatment… (4/12)COVID19US	0

Smug, Seth. A journalist can learn and know. I cite the WHOCan the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  Telling that you found simple citation to be smug. And that you identified that assertion as the thing I was referring to without any basis other than your own doubts about your proclamations (or perhaps concerns expressed by others) . . .  You guys arguing led me to that paper, which were actually really interesting for. But that first citation wasn't meant to be kind, right? Let's be kind to each other right now, online and off. just admit, you have spread misinformation about a deadly disease. All to further your brand. Deranged narcissism -- apologize and admit you were wrong	0
_W_Kuczynski Should I wear a mask to protect myself?Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. […]Tutaj, poniżej. zalecenie noszenia masek. Nasi lekarze (ci najbardziej medialni) mówią, że maski powinni nosić tylko zakażeni. W Czechach nie można wyjść z domu bez maski. To jakieś szaleństwo... Kto w końcu ma rację?  No właśnie..._W_Kuczynski Moim skromnym zdaniem WHO et al. Poza argumentem ekonomicznym na ww. stronie, dochodzi jeszcze fałszywe poczucie bezpieczeństwa. Takiej maski nie wolno nosić zbyt długo, trzeba ją umieć zdjąć, żeby się nie „pobrudzić”, a na koniec wyrzucić. Kto w domu ma kosz na odpady medyczne?	0
 From WHO info page. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. In what way? This one spreads far quicker, and it has already reached far more people than SARS did. Also, it takes 4 to 5 weeks to die, and so nobody knows the fatality death rate yet. Right off, his data is wrong. It started early December - not the 29th December. Also the World Health Orgaization says it's worse than SARS. If a disease only spreads to a thousand people, and it kills 10%, that is only a 100 dead. If a disease spreads to 5 million people, and it kills 3% (current fatality rate), it kills 30,000 people. It is the ease of spreading that makes it more dangerous. I would still put that on par with a bad flu bug, most people don't die from it and that fatality percentage can change based on how it's reacted to and where geographically you look.  With proper prevention this won't result in a pandemic. Yes, I know that. But it takes approximately 5 weeks from the date of manifestation of the illness (not the incubation period) to die. Most people have not recovered yet. So the death rate might be a lot higher. The fact that SARS didn't spread easily means it was less dangerous.	0

 _paul  What is the solution then? Can't go for herd immunity it would kill too many based on a 0.5-1% IFR , can't rely on a vaccine that may or may not come, does aggressive track and trace actually work? I'm not sure it does. I think it's the asymptomatic spreaders that are the problemIn Italy, fatalities have been under 100 every day in June. Still far too many, but down from 900 at the peak.Just 163 new infections were reported yesterday.They first eased their lockdown at the start of May. The progress is encouraging for one of my favourite countries. What's going on in China it is a bit worrying_paul  The question is, how are they getting a resurgence? It seemed like they had eliminated it. Where had it been hiding? Someone who had it for a very long time? Maybe a resovoiur in the body? _paul  Makes it impossible to lock the virus down.	0

   What is humorous about herd immunity?Florida Gov  says state officials are making PSAs targeting younger Floridians who have let their guard down abt spread of COVID-19. Median age of coronavirus cases in Broward is now 33 yrs old. In Duval, 30. In Hillsborough Co, it’s 31. In Seminole, it’s 26 yrs old    And we achieve herd immunity before the fall flu season.   Super funny til someone you know gets it and dies.   Not a damn thing; it's deadly serious. A lot of people would have to die in short order to get there quickly. You need 60-70% to achieve. I frankly don't feel like sacrificing a large percentage of people over 60 to do it. 🤷🏽‍♀️   Data is showing that the best way to avoid infecting the at-risk 60+ population is don’t put COVID patients in nursing homes. The median age infected in the counties listed were all below 35. That’s exactly where you want the immunity to build.	0
COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

"For asking that question, , you will be told that you are saying Covid-19 is 'just like the flu'. It will be a lie. But it is the lie invariably told about anyone who asks about govt response to previous high fatalities from flu complications. Why do govt supporters lie?   Copied from the ONS site today: ""In Week 13, 18.8% of all deaths mentioned “Influenza or Pneumonia”, COVID-19, or both. In comparison, for the five-year average, 19.6% of deaths mentioned “Influenza and Pneumonia”.""  So less deaths from all 3 combined so far this year.  It puts different people in hospital compared with flu. The data are clear on this.   They also said: ""“Influenza and Pneumonia” has been included for comparison, as a well-understood cause of death involving respiratory infection that is likely to have somewhat similar risk factors to COVID-19.""   Key words - similar risk factors.  God you people must walk around with your eyes close - this is a totally infectious disease , it absolutely is not the flu  Please look at this invaluable extract. Look at the dates involved. The MSM do. not. understand.  How about figures on how many front line staff become seriously ill or die treating patients with seasonal flu,you don’t seem to care"	1

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. 	0
" We are humans, we see patterns, similarities.  If someone were to ask you, ""What is covid-19 like?""...how would you answer?  Would you say ""it's throughly dissimilar to anything else on Earth?"".  Of course not.  There ARE similarities...to MANY things on EarthThe death rate may be inflated, but this still illustrates why we must be cautious &amp; vigilant. We MUST reopen the economy but we must be smart and use common sense. Please wear a mask and keep your distance. Many companies have shown this is possible while keeping businesses open  That isn't even to mention how many of our 60k deaths that were incorrectly categorized as ""Covid related"" or ""presumed Covid related"", or ""underlying conditions that we THINK Covid exasperated"" This point is why I explicitly mentioned “inflated” deaths. Anything we put out in media...that has the objective of making people cautious, will make them scared.  Anything that is supposed to make them respect the disease, will make them fear it. I don’t believe in fear-mongering. I also don’t believers prudent to censor the seriousness of this illness. I the purpose of the charts was specifically to make a direct comparison. It was to make a contrast.  Not a comparison.  You expressly warned against comparisons."	0

Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support.The goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.	0

 And what do you mean “Not during a global pandemic?” Did the pandemic just END?! Did I just completely miss that? The way people were talking these “protests” will result in many more deaths from the coronavirus alone. It’s disgusting and hypocritical to think these “protests” &gt; Do you hear yourself?? The riots have way more people in close proximity to each other than we’ve seen in MONTHS. It’s far more important now than ever to enforce that. Not only are so many people NOT social distancing, but they’re also causing destruction. Are 100% fine when LITERALLY ONE WEEK AGO if there was any gathering even 10% the size of some of these it would have been ground upon and shut down immediately. This hyposcriscy needs to end.	0

Cops bought Burger King for Dylann Roof following his arrest   its a good tactic lol _ricky20  I'm asking for tacos and a large horchata if I ever get taken in.  Dylann Roof is a Hoax and saying this also happened is being done to trigger you into more distraction really !!!!! Buy the racist killer Burger King I would have given him nothing should have let him die of hunger  he hadn't eaten in days.  I guess he had it his way lol Eyewitness news?? Unfollow Probably to convince him to confess. Thats not uncommon. Idiots, that's what tax dollars do? i think they heard about the two for $5 deal He's in their custody.  Would you rather they starve him and make the news that way?? Which is common practice for many police departments since they aren't equipped with kitchens and are required to feed their prisoners disgusted. I'm disgusted. this is disgusting you can't starve people that in-custody!! There is no logical reason for them to do that.  He deserved nothing kind at all! are you fucking kidding me? Don't they always do this? It's to get him to cooperate and confess.	1

    100k dead, and 4.3% positive. So...how many die to reach 20% positive?40%?What is herd immunity? 80%?That’s A LOT of death. Great catch, Don!Kudlow to : “Hospitalizations may be going up but that’s because elected procedures are now permitted.” Texas has reported the number of those hospitalized with Coronavirus is at an all-time high. Arizona warned that its ICU’s are filling up with COVID-19 cases.  Florida has had several days in a row of record high COVID case reports   Case reports without context of testing is garbage data. Especially since serological studies show at least 4.3% of FL positive. Why this is lost on the media is ridiculous.  But considering everything is viewed thru stupid political bias it is clear.    Herd is not anywhere near 80%. The 4.3% was FL not the US.  In NY it is north of 20%. In FL pop of 21m. 1 person under 25 has died. From WSJ: “for those under the age of 65 the risk of dying from covid isn’t much higher than getting in a car accident driving to work”    You think US is above 4.3%?!Bless your heart. 	0

Trump says COVID-19 is just like the flu. Flu mortality is about 14.3 per 100,000 cases.COVID-19 mortality is currently 3,400 per 100,000 cases.They are not the same and Trump cannot be trusted to protect us. Right! Last year 63k people died of flu. If it had been Covid19 that number would have been over a million. I was saying that frequently to liberals about a week ago because it was a popular anti-anti-vaxer taking point.I really dislike hyper partisan people.	1

You had this evil person's money, and you gave it back to him?      I think it is a diversion tactic, meant to muddle up the waters. I am not fooled.  Because her vote holds more value than her color, which speaks volumes about our political system  already corrupt   It's too late. Well my mom was right. If you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.. Shameful.Alleged? What's wrong with  ?  Oi Foi saber     It's useful to have black ppl on their side to confirm racist views &amp; bash other black ppl   she pushes the agenda and that's all they care about  Oh no why did she do that it's her buddy is she leaving the GOP   Don't bash her or anyone else for not returning $$ sooner. No box marked ""Racist"" on contribution forms!  they donated because she saying everything that they are thinking so keep the money you FAKE She was surprised?   xbz   I'm not American so forgive me. How come a white supremacist was give money to a black woman's campaign    Clearly they felt her ideals represented their interests... which SHOULD serve as wake-up call  Smart Idea NOW tell your Party President cand's TedCruz &amp; MikeHuckabee to be smart about the ConfederateFlag  what a shameful empty shell of a human. taking $ from ppl who revel in oppression/marginalization of your own race.  The presidential donations were reported by The Guardian on Sunday. Holt gave $1,750 to Paul and $8,500 to Cruz's What a hypocrite. She's returning the money now as it came to light. Wasn't someone checking donars?      Whatever 🔚   Too little too late!   I'm racist so I'd like the US gov to return all my money back that I've ""donated"" over the years.  Imagine that...

Beheading Victim Colleen Hufford—Speak UP Obama, we can't HEAR you! via   tcot 2A   yeah..work place violence my a&amp;*!  How sad for her  and her family! :( Frankly, I don't care what color or sex.  Authorities need to stop beheadings in America now.  My heart breaks for her, her family. Could've been any one of us. Crickets from the admin, just awful.  Was the guy a cop? Did the police fail to arrest him, then send him on a 2 month (&amp; counting) paid vacation? Ferguson  Memorial page for ColleenHufford ~   Only after Ouseless reads the polls again will he come out and speak on the subject!A coward puppet he is!  Rest in Peace Dear Woman~  This is an act of terrorism just like Fort Hood.  Obama's no comment says a great deal about the POS!!!  THEIR GOD ,ALLAH IS SATAN ,CAIN MY BROTHER I AM ABEL ,JESUSCRIST, YESHUA  spreadingthelove of ColleenHufford  Very sad we have such a sick gov that loves Islam so much the death of Americans means nothing.BOOOOM, !  Take note !    There was no cop involved in Trayvon's death, either. But Obama still made public comments about it.   What a horrible way to lose someone you love, I am sorry for your loss.  Where is Obama n Holder on this one? They were all mouth when it was White on black! L don't hear U Racists   She's white, and a Christian. Reason enough for Obama to not take notice.  eye for an eye. Come on over to Dearborn, Michigan help yourself  just a typical white person like his grandma.  Depends on who could be Obama's son I suppose. Anything less doesn't get his attention. No benefit for him. ||| KEEPING THIS FAM IN PRAYER &amp; w/CONDOLENCES.TELL OBAMA ITS NOT A CIVIL MATTER. ITS TERRORISM.-me freedomfever  You seem really angry.  If Holder went to Ferguson, a rep from the WH should visit this family. Such a disgrace to have a blatant racist as pres.  More folks whose lives R destroyed by Islam. I pray 4 her loving family who R dealing with her barbaric death.   the dividing is being done by Tea Bag Right Wing. 📚  And the media has shown so few pics of her but tons of that animal, and not even current ones.  shameful.  Racist Bigots are always liars, new converts can't be devout, you also forgot mentally ill,  Because white Christians aren't rioting. this is so devastating!! My heartfelt prayers to the familyTHX “: Colleen Hufford: (unlike Ferguson)   gag orders; no Trayvon case, no riots...  an absolutely disgraceful situation WE THE PEOPLE extend our apology  because our Adm has failed their duty OK you anti American pile of shit.. you are stupid NO COP INVOLVED IN THE WOMAN'S DEATH.. are you  really this stupid.. really?	0

      Back to the assumption in her post. What is the reason to assume uniform distribution of herd immunity when we don't see this with the current SARs virus, nor do we see it with others? She implies the lack of this uniformity explains lockdown success. False dichotomy.      Smarty pants...Explain to us why this would be true.We will wait while you hone your juvenile insults. _McKernan      Sorry if u felt attacked, i meant the comment of mark above me who seems to think a person tweeting about her scientific work has to discuss it in the twitter feed. I‘m sure she’s discussing a lot with her colleagues. + she even entered some discussions in the comments._McKernan      I can’t answer for her but ask urself is Twitter the right place for a discussion like that? There are science forums where al day long people discuss about the newest research. Discussing work is part of science but not ob twitter _McKernan     If she doesn’t want it to be discussed, then why the hell doesn’t she solely use the “science forums”. It’s called social media for a reason. Give me a break._McKernan      Agreed Kevin, I don’t understand this either._McKernan      We don’t see these effect in measured cases. See Iceland which went out of their way to test all age groups and a very light “lockdown”. Primary schools were still open and kids still less likely to get it which implies Deans hypothesis is wrong.   _McKernan   I find it interesting, and telling, that Dr. Dean won’t even engage in discussion here.	0
  there has been zero confirmation that gunman is down. Maybe let news outlets on scene handle the reporting. my thoughts also what's your source? That's not confirmed!

But Democrats say that Syrian refugees are 3 year-old orphans. So why are they worried about them buying guns? Where is the Declaration of War by France? Force NATO to meet their treaty obligations. Have you ever seen a 3 yr old shoot a gun? They might be on to something! that's how a group thinks when it is so far removed from reality let me guess you are the oh so compassionate religious right? Not in CT!The law abiding citizens of CT cannot buy an AR-15 or AR-10! Malloy is a disgrace!He and the Dems make CT dañgerous! 3 YO orphans? If that is so, the only vetting needed would be for foster/adopt parents.  I expect their politically correct vetting policies can't tell diff between 3 yr old &amp; single fighting age male  mind boggling/just heard it this morning/he conveniently did not mention the adult males/why is he so focused on refugees?  Stop asking great questions!!! They're gonna call you a racist!!!, In pictures &amp; video of refugees. There seem to be more 18-30 yr old males than 3 year old children. Pres has never seen the pics Settle them in Chicago. No guns there. Its one big gun free zone... Get the1st Div out of Ft Riley and surrounded Mizzu with concertina wire.  Put the refugees there.  It is a safe place after all. the Libs are out of touch and delusional. well,  they aren't because they gave them their guns.	1

"I still have friends on Facebook insisting COVID-19 is:• Just like the flu• No worse than H1N1• Media hysteria• Blue state politics• Merely fear• Lack of faithOne can see how scapegoats and hyper-partisanship create minds that are malleable to false narratives. Gonna be a lot of torches and pitchforks and looking for a scapegoat, when the consequences of their actions catch up with them. Same. Except there’s been a slight shift towards accepting it — and more discussions now of who’s to blame (following the POTUS’s racist lead). The shift from denial to pitchforks was only a matter of time. It’s beyond horrifying. Yeah, me too. Mostly I ignore them but sometimes I say: google Italy. seeing a ""China did it to us"" conspiracy rising I haven’t seen much of that. I just don’t see how people can misread the data so badly."	1

 What is a coronavirus?Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause disease in animals. Seven, including the new virus, have made the jump to humans, but most just cause cold-like symptoms.Two other coronaviruses – Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) 1/2 2/2  (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – are much more severe, having killed more than 1,500 people between them since 2002.For your information Sir,	0

Q: Is wearing rubber gloves while out in the public effective in preventing the new coronavirus infection?A: No. Regularly washing your bare hands offers more protection against catching COVID19 than wearing rubber gloves.➡️ Avoid shaking hands!!! Respiratory viruses can be passed by shaking hands and touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Greet people with a wave, a nod, or a bow instead! KnowTheFacts: ➡️COVID19 coronavirus KnowTheFacts on COVID19. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease.The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.➡️ How should I greet another person to avoid catching the new coronavirus?To prevent COVID19 it is safest to avoid physical greetings include a wave, a nod, or a bow.➡️  Rubber gloves in summer in Australia... no thank you. slipperymess I'm wearing rubber gloves. I'm less likely to touch my face with them on. I always wash my hands as soon as I remove them.  Iya bos Ternyata begini bude _woman Kamu camkan itu wahai rakyat negara kesayangan..

A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for Adolf Hitler. literally whoa whoa whoa.....hitler was way more credible. And had better hair.

What's your point?	1
   I can look further, but on the WHO website under “Should I worry about COVID-19?” it says, “about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care.” This is a very scary virus.  How is it that even Trump now gets that COVID-19 is a much more dangerous virus in America than the flu, but you don’t? If your life depended on it, could you explain exponential growth?   1. Its about not overwhelming the health care infrastructure we have and the effects on others when encountering an overwhelmed system and provider shortage. You are already starting to see cancelled appts etc.2. Everyone dies but even the sick and elderly should have dignity.   People visiting ERs doesn’t cause ~15% of cases to require hospitalization and ~5% needing a ventilator (last numbers I saw). In fact, those numbers are lowered by people going to the ER when they could have stayed home and never reported their case.   2/ And, from 2 days ago: 	0
 Simple antibiotics kill germs and coronavirus is a germ therefore antibiotics kill coronavirus. But if coronavirus is smart enough then we can ask coronavirus to kill the bacteria before releasing the antibiotics therefore we can kill two birds with one stone and save money.By next week, coronavirus will be Trump’s new best friend  As long as the stock market goes up it’s all fine If the stock market doesn’t go up then he we call Putin and MBS and ask them to stop fighting then we will be fine.	1

Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

"What is herdimmunity threshold for COVID19?A topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp; huge consequences for long term impact. New paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially (spoiler: we still don't know value). Thread.Human populations are NOT WELL-MIXED &amp; HOMOGENOUS, so calcs give likely upper bound. Q: So what is herd immunity threshold (HIT) for real pops?A: *Usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.Background: If we know reproductive number R0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (HIT) for WELL-MIXED HOMOGENOUS population is simply 1-1/R0. (Note R0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space).1) If some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering HIT. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).2) If some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces HIT. 3)If some people don't transmit that also reduces HIT.Positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. Sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.However, see paper by  that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than Science paper cited above. Fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects HIT, f, for R0=3; so HIT=0.66, f = 0.94. Science paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces HIT. It considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.The strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. The citation they give is NOT a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ Matlab files. It's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there.  can probably provide best onesThe take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. NOT well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential ""activity"" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce HIT for R0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43. The conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value. What I find puzzling is that this paper is in Science. It's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. It isn't as general as  paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. Many older papers say same thing. paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on HIT, f based on data (colored lines in figure). In idealized population, early vaccination to HIT will prevent outbreak b/c Rt=R0*S/N so Rt&lt;1. However, an epidemic will overshoot HIT &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*R0)). For R0=2.5 (reasonable for COVID19 in some pops), HIT=0.6, and f = 0.89.These simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led  to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70% of pop would get infected without interventions. Most articles cited the 70% *BUT*  knew that...I'd like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. But ...Serological data from NYC suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or R0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20% - I added horiz dashed line). Together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;1-1/R0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1-exp(-(f*R0)), but by how much is still unknown. Ugh.  smartly gave a wide range 40-70% (20-60% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions.Unfortunately, uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for HIT for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does R0). The take home message is want to get to HIT by vaccination NOT infection. Are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from HIV or STIs with highly stratified risk groups)?COVID19 Yes. See link at end to interview with  that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial.  did some work on this in 2007 or so also when I recall correctly: “""A programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available.""_leenders  This is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial).  Do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has, how long it lasts?  Not yet, sadly!  without reading: the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading.   unroll please Salam, please find the unroll here: : What is herdimmunity threshold for COVID19? A topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp;…  Talk to you soon. 🤖  ""What is this about nerd immunity?""  Assumptions about heterogeneity are just that, assumptions. But there is plenty of convincing evidence that slow down in spread is strongly linked to lockdowns; despite high levels of infection. Thus heterogeneity is likely less than the models predict. "	0

Is Covid-19 airborne?? The CDC has stated it's potentially airborne, although I don't know if there's anything concrete The other two coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, i believe, were indeed airborne tho Research so far seems to indicate the virus can survive up to 3 hours in tiny droplets suspended in air, making airborne transmission plausible. Main form of transmission seems to be physical contact between people or transmission through intermediary of another solid surface.	0

"Oregon community helps mother after boy punished for being tardy due to vehicle problems:   So what did the school accomplish? Or or perhaps ask what did the school lose? I'm glad this worked out for the family, but wow, the vindictiveness and meanness of the adult who thought this was ok is beyond words. there are still good people in this world. Should never punish kids for things they have no control over. Always ask is this policy educationally sound?&amp; is it kind? _fan If this is the way schools operate now I say to all parents take your kids out. You do not want them learning these lessons. This is ridiculous. What a terrible thing to do. If this ever happen to one of my boys. I would kick whoever made up this rules ASS!! This is no way to treat a child.  definitely a piss poor policy on the schools part. Great way to damage the psyche of a six year old. another example of a school being part of the problem instead of part of the solution how do you punish a struggling family....thank God for those who stepped up to Help. this is crazy, and why are 6 year olds getting detention? If someone did this to my kids I would kick some ass. This is ridiculous and schools think they have a free pass to do anything. that's awful that he was punished like that   Shameful.  Glad Mom got a new car, but the ""root of the problem"" wasn't a faulty vehicle...it was a faulty school principle. wow I would be very very upset.  How embarrassing  for the kid.. this is disgusting    No wonder more and more families are choosing to home school their kids. The kid doesn't drive. Facryinoutloud  good solution for all This is a great story of an Oregon community and all but what about the school? The school needs to adopt a new practice for tardiness! what the hell is this....? what kind of messed up school is this?? That's terrible -horrible thing - shame on that teacher! Struggle to understand some of the rules that US schools have, where discriminations and bullying seems to be allowed Long Islanders hit by Hurricanesandy still suffering NYRISING Failed us . needs to help pray4us donate Omg that is meat up and sad :'( people should loose there jobs over this awful aww this is so sad. How is it that little boys fault? Stupid school, stupid policy. So glad this family received a new van. this school system needs to stop this petty BULL:$&amp;  she needs to get him to school on time......he is there doing catch work......his books are in his hand  Looks Like The Kid Eat For Lunch"	0

18. Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 14. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates 15. Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous 16. Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or any other lung disease. 17.

"Would especially draw attention to 's comment “What is the trigger for reintroducing mitigation efforts?” Grad said. “As you lift social distancing, you can expect a resurgence of cases as susceptible people are available and since we’ve not hit herd immunity.”   ""Since we are FAR from herd immunity"".... they need to emphasize that.....  Opening up doesn't need to entail RISING cases. If you had really good control and have mitigation measures like mask wearing and good tracing, it should just decrease the rate cases are dropping.This presumption that rising cases and death are inevitable is not helping."	0
Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.Pls Don't panic people with fake news because it's not real All Facts are in these threads 	0
 When can we expect the full results from this survey so we can interpret comprehensive results with proper context? Or do we just wait for you to selectively release sections to support the most convenient narrative of the day?Lot's of folks claiming school choice only benefits the wealthy, but our survey of Albertans would disagree. Students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended every choice of education. The percentages were pretty consistent as well.Education choice benefits all. abed  This is rhetorical of course because the survey was so inadequately prepared and questions so leading that it was a rigged method to gather the biased responses you wanted.  There is a wealth of research evidence that shows, for example, the devastating effects of summer learning loss on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Having publicly-funded charter schools able to innovate and respond to these issues is making things better for kids.	0

It would only tell you if you have it or not at the time of testing. You can catch it within minutes of being tested.

I've read 2 hours out is bad for raw meat but I think(?) This bacon is pre-cooked. You can probably tell from the appearance and smell. If it’s not discolored and still smells like bacon (mmmm, bacon), should be OK. Today was pretty cool outside anyway, and four hours isn’t bad for cured meat. But don’t take any chances...	0

     I DM'd you without ANY response.  I do not have my absentee ballot nor does my partner.  How can you expect to know legitimate results in a primary election when 10,000s of ballots may very well be simply missing and your fault?  Can we please get some extra time? What if we legally requested it by June 16 and we still haven't gotten it by end of day today? You can tweet  to check your status. If you are worried about waiting, you could try voting in person at your poll site if you are willing to go there tomorrow.I'm sorry there aren't better answers.   I am still waiting on both an absentee ballot and a status update from . So nervous thinking about how many people must be in the same position... but woke up this morning like, I bet  is on it!   Update: They replied on Twitter after I sent this tweet.  says my ballot was sent for printing and still needs to be postmarked by tomorrow, and if I have questions, call a hotline. I'm currently 78th in the queue, wish me luck!     Hi Ian, I'm sorry you are having issue voting. You can vote in person if you feel comfortable doing so. If you continue to have issues, please call  to speak with nonpartisan trained volunteers working to make sure voters get access to the ballot box.	0

FACT - CDC estimates that COVID-19 may be 10x those numbers. I get tired of retweeting that because so many are tied to the distraction claims of the Trump GOP who’ve battered MSM making comparative claims that COVID-19 is just like the flu. It’s misleading the public!  That is what we keep hearing, but the numbers of deaths do not support that SO FAR. I freely admit that I am just a dumbass, but 23,000 deaths so far seems a lot more important that the few we've seen from the coronavirus to me.  Early days. Not enough tested yet.	1

  _Yates_Maths  _lilico  So IFS for NY State is around 0.8% and for the older UK population should be around 0.9%.But we have 60K dead (FT analysis) and 3M inferred by serology Which is an IFR of 2%?What is happening?I have a theory..._puck  _Yates_Maths  _lilico  Correction, _  doesn't seem to attribute all excess deaths to covid 19 infections. A significant fraction may have resulted from indirect effects of the epidemic  _Yates_Maths  _lilico  _ The acid test will be what happens to excess deaths after the wave passes. If it turns negative that will indicate some of the deaths were of people where their end was hastened by a few weeks. If it just returns to zero that will show that they were robbed of years.  _Yates_Maths  _lilico  Elsewhere, I have read that 40% of UK deaths are in care homes.But 400K residents care homes is only 0.6% of the UK population.What may be happening is care homes are a lot further along the road to herd immunity than the rest of us.  _Yates_Maths  _lilico  If in a years time 80% of people in care and 80% of the rest of us have been infected, it will all come out in the wash and the iFR will be (probably?) 0.9-1% for the UK, but if right now we have - I dunno - 4% in the community and 20% in care it will artificially raise the IFR.	0
Q: Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?A: No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The 2019-nC0V is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should  not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.  Chinese tech companies have donated nearly 3 billion yuan ($432.5 million) to help fight the outbreak of novel coronavirus-related pneumonia in Central China's Hubei province.	0
Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth busters Issa thread👇👇👇Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

"An openly gay man said that he and his partner met with Pope Francis a day before Kim Davis did  And there's no way the Pope could bless them and say he's a man of God.

"":An openly gay said - he and met with Pope a day before Kim Davis did _rdz  So do you think he needs man or woman for sex? what do you want a cookie? Who cares who was first? Did Pope give the gay couple his blessing? and tell em to keep up the fight! It was an old friend of the Pope who happened to be gay. Vatican is trying to spin this as cover over secret meeting w/Kim Davis You're a trip. pretty sure his boss once met with tax collectors and prostitutes.  WalklikeJesus is this the Catholic Churches attempt to look neutral  when it comes to gay rights?

Just let it go... I've had enough of the gay talk Show-offs! I don't get all that squeak! So Pope can meet gay people, but can't meet Kim Davis? I smell hypocrisy or stupidity here. who cares? Why did the Pope even waste his time meeting Kim Davis?  Kim Davis should be back in jail, not meeting with the Pope/Reporters. no one can trust this Pope. Now we're sure. Did he also meet an openly woman woman - maybe an openly man manWas the pontiff openly Catholic?"	0

 Why do we need it? It’s based on what facts? Yes the Founding Fathers were white, males, and many owned slaves. Probably a few were gay. So what! But a play to re-engineer the truth?      A theater director at Harvard University announced this week that she will produce an all-female and LGBT version of the classic musical, 1776. The production is scheduled to debut on Broadway in the spring of 2021.         What if it’s a comedy?  Do you think people will figure out that a Broadway musical is not intended to teach history?        No too stupid! Hamilton has a largely black cast and they portray historical figures that owned slaves yet quote them as righteous people. Teachers have to teach the truth not liberal make believe facts. Like George Washington owned slaves!	0
   I understand that you need to give boilerplate health advice. But my point is: if the results of tests are taking a week how useful is that for someone who is asymptomatic who is not able to isolate to wait for the results?When can we expect testing with a faster turnaround?   RE: CHA free COVID testingIf one is non-symptomatic and it takes 5+ days after a COVID test to find out the results, how useful is that delayed test result to prevent that person from spreading the virus?My goal before doing a week of vacation and visiting a few people at the end of July is to get tested before I go. But if I'd need to get tested 5-8 days before leaving, is this even a useful exercise? If the people you are visiting are vulnerable, it would be good to get a negative test and then isolate until you see them.     Residents tested at a CambMA mobile site or CHA's East Cambridge site receive results from . These sites are not designed to help residents make real-time decisions about visits or vacations; they are mainly intended for those w/symptoms or who think they were exposed   . calls residents within 1-2 days of receiving the test result. If people do not answer the phone or return the call that day, it takes longer to reach them. To find out the status of test results, leave a message at 617-665-3848 &amp; you will receive a callback.	0

Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

"Farook family attorney says brothers in the family never saw Tashfeen Malik's face because she always wore a burka.    How comical. Lawyer b.s. these guys are jokes just want to be on tv 😂😂😂😂   they are CAIR lawyers...  not just paid by CAIR.  beware taqiyya, something we must tolerate? So where is her passport photo, visa photo, CDL photo etc.?  Burqas should be banned. Imagine wearing a ski mask everywhere you go. You're kidding. Those two attorneys are a joke. Grandma didn't know what was going on? Right! weird  CAIRMalik is evidence U.S. is not prepared to adequately vet Islamic migrants. Let's hit the pause button until we're ready. That is strange since she new how to handle a weapon very well, and someone help build the bombs. The family  knows more IMO.  // BS call BS on that. .. is that why the pictures are blacked out what we're still giving her respect. They are just paid professional liars... FYI those lawyers saying this woman was just a housewife . WTF with a Arsenal in their garage WAKE UP ! yet met her husband on a dating website? There's your sign. Ding! STRANGE THE  LAWYER SAID,  THE FAMILY SAID SOMEONE MADE FUN OF THE KILLER'S BEARD AT THE COMPANY. WHEN DID HE TELL HIS FAMILY THAT,? where did they get these lawyers from?  Idiots.   Clueless.  Mixture of convenience rituals with religious philosophy make Porsche pulled by Camel as driver got money, no license. Sad.

These guys are outrageous, describing FBI agent ""as if he could be a plant in a mosque?"" Very Incendiary language SanBernadino but everyone is surprised he became radicalized , wanting a wife with a full burka was radical to begin with  misogynism is radical Wahabist/Salafist radical fanatics!!...liberal Muslims they are not!    these two a joke  but stated she looked like every American girl.  i think ski mask should be illegal.but no pushing to outlaw them That's Bullshit, wrapped in Taqyyia and served with ""CAIR"" 😠 In France the veil is illegal...due to the very firm separation of church and state.  Good idea? really stupid to disclose anything about fbi interrogator impossible. the mother in law lived with them.   garbage don't we have a picture with a hole in her head? why did they call them ""alleged"" shooters?  I thought the police killed them in a shootout?  What more evidence do they need?😒 Would it be considered intolerant to suggest we check the guy with the beard for a vest bomb?"	1

"1.15 million Americans have been killed by guns since John Lennon's death  that's totally fucked up.  Might even be an understatement. 35 years ago, we lost a legend. Today marks the anniversary of John Lennon's passing. unbelievable it's not the gun that killed them. It was the idiot in control of it! Its not the pencil's fault you fail the test oh right. You prefer pressure cooker bombs. Mostly black on black. Still a tragedy, but they need to decide that black lives matter. mostly by Muslims, in Donald Trumps head. how many have done marijuana? 1.475 million have been killed in motor vehicle accidents. Yet we still sell/drive cars.  And how many other foreigners have been killed by american guns around the world?I don't normally share things like this, but this is absolutely devastating...   how many killed since some other famous random person died That's a shame. ""all we are saying, is give gun control a chance""JohnLennon    that is why  continuously asking congress 2pass anti-gun law, he doesn't want more American to be killed  John Lennon is hardly some random famous person. 1.15 million deaths in 35 years by one cause is a lot. break down the numbers: 2013 - 21,175 by suicide with a firearm / 11,208 deaths by homicide - paints a different picture."	0

"First, what is a coronavirus? Ulmer: This particular strain started in Wuhan Province. It traveled from animals to humans.She said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first.Panelists:Beaumont Public Health Director Sherry UlmerBeaumont Emergency Management Coordinator Tim OcnashekBISD Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Anita FrankFrom Beaumont Psychiatric Clinic, Jason MensahUlmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in Beaumont or Jefferson County.She said she doesn't want to downplay the flu. With both viruses, the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised.""We're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu.""""If we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us.""She notes because COVID-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine.Ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in Texas, but Mensah says there are 51.Ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold.I'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. I know (thanks to TheDaily I think) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia.So, mild is relative here.Ulmer said she's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine.She says that's why it's important to continue ""tried and true"" healthcare methods. Wash your hands, stay home when you're sick.Clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays.Lysol, Clorox and 409 are CDC-approved to kill the virus.""We understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours.""Feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread. He gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. He's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days.Ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. The virus is transmitted person-to-person. She says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets.That's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing.Ulmer said the health department is putting together ""soemthing"" so people know what the next step is if Jefferson County has a confirmed case.(I'm going to use Tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.)So ... Tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures. That includes limiting crowds, increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1/2measures. I would like to add, as of Friday, the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds. The comment was at this time, danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken. 2/2Tim says ""we're not trying to scare people. There's a lot of bad information out there.""He encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on Facebook or from friends and spreading it like it's a fact.""We would encourage people to be patient because it's a fluid situation."" - FeldshauHe notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. However when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming.Ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. And several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them.""We are as prepared as we can be with the information we're getting. Of course it's fluid, but we're accustomed to these types of situations.""Reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.She said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are ""doing very well.""""For our children it sounds like God has smiled on us.""Now talking about ""flattening the curve."" People are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.""This is not here today and gone tomorrow."" -FeldschauUlmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would ""tax our healthcare system."" Should the city/county get there, it would have to look at ""alternative"" ways to treat people. She didn't expand on what those alternatives are.She said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.""I we know that you're coming, the staff can be ready for you. They can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus."" 2/2Feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.""If we ever lose control, we're going to have a serious problem.""From comment section on the video: ""If this virus is just like the flu &amp; spreads like viruses do (airborne) I’m not understanding the panic &amp; closure of so many things? What is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don’t do it for flu?""This seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments. Someone simply responded ""yassss"" and another said people don't know what to do ""so they just shut everything down I guess.""So even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ..."	0

"   I think you are misinterpreting things. The link you cited does not say why the WHO advises against wearing a mask, it simply lists the risks. This WHO link says why they advise against it:   See Q ""Should I wear a mask to protect myself?""  Tom, I live in Hong Kong and hence I wear mask, but this article is misrepresenting the facts. The most important one:By far the most experts including WHO don't advise mask not because of shortage, but because the wrong way most people use them.   Many people wash their hands in a wrong way. But the WHO doesn't advice people to stop washing their hands. Instead, they give proper instructions. Why is that not happening with regard to the use of masks then? Most probably because a shortage.   They do, please read.Also, wrongly washed hands is better than not washed hands.Wrongly used mask is potentially harmful.   Thanks for sharing. I think it says both. I was not entirely correct. Nevertheless, the second reason should still be mentioned.   Can you give me a source where the WHO says incorrect use of masks might lead to more infections? (Not an ironic question, just not seem to able to retrieve)"	0

"@_dedenne__   So what is your argument? By the data, I believe this virus is overblown and not much worse statistically than the flu. We have prevented herd immunity with quarantines, cost millions their jobs and livelihoods and killed thousands of elderly due to bad governors.@_dedenne__   Oh really? Trump did everything the ""experts"" advised - too much IMO. What happened to states rights? This was a NYC and NY/NJ state failure. That is where half of the deaths are from. 2 million cases is much less than seasonal flu cases (with a vaccine). @_dedenne__  Herd immunity is not sure.Say it is there, you would have clogged the HC system with the sick as happened in Italy.And is happening now in Sweden which tried that approach and now recognize it wasn’t the right one."	0
6: How does COVID-19 spread? A: We are learning more and more about how COVID-19 spreads. Evidence originally was very strong that it was present in the droplets of people who were infected. When those people cough or sneeze the virus can be transmitted to others who breathe in the virus or if their hands become contaminated with the virus and then they touch their face.There is more evidence that the virus lives on surfaces for long enough periods of time to be transmitted up to several days later. People who have no symptoms are also able to spread the virus.This is part of the reason it is very hard to contain and slow the spread of COVID-19 without taking the current measures of social distancing. 	0
 I think some of the reasons for this has been a dearth of information about 5g.

Why isn't this spoken about? The vision, the use of, the reasons why...  There have been articles explaining all this in loving detail for about four or five years now ... but the anti-5G people clearly have been closing their eyes and/or don't know how to use Google or Bing._weber  Yes, possibly there have...In terms of a bigger picture, why increase the capacity of a wireless network?For the layman?Are you not interested as to why they spring up and become popular, these theories?Just saying people are lazy or stupid does not cut it  There's literally pages and pages of info on 5G that's piss easy to find.  Can you direct me to any please?  I've discussed this with agnostics, why does mobile telecoms need to justify itself, or prove it's safety over full-fibre or say BMW 3-series 6th generation? Evolution happens. Arguing it does not would mean we'd all be walking around with voice-only TACS phones and dial-up.  All the answers are out there for these fanatical luddites.

" so, the WHO estimates that of people who get infected, 1 in 5 will need hospital care. so 20%  look under ""should i worry about COVID-19?""w/coronavirus, about 20% of infected ppl end up needing hospital care. MI population is 9M. if 1% of the pop gets infected, as many as 18k could need hospital care.as of march 2 there were 6431 free hospital beds in MI. someone pls tell me my math is wrong😳 flatteningthecurve  Where did you get the stat that 20% of infected people need to be hospitalized? That seems like a high number. Ok so I got some clarification - that’s 20% of people who felt bad enough to get tested. Many more people are walking around with COVID-19 and either don’t know it or aren’t getting tested. So the numbers are a little better that way... that would be a lot better! is that on the WHO site?also, that 18k number is assuming 1% of the population in MI is infected. projections/estimates are as high as 40%. italy has just 17k positive cases and it's overwhelmed the system, where the bed ratio was higher than here."	0
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19.

Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.

An individual can carry the virus and be without symptoms for several days. Some carriers won't get sick at all. But the virus is still in their system. If they cough or sneeze without covering their mouths, or cover their mouths without washing hands after --&gt;_chelsea and then touch you, or a door knob, or gas pump, or bag of chips that you then touch, it is transmitted. Here's the CDC site that talks about it in a bit more detail:    The ""good news"" is that they feel the non-symptomatic spread isn't as prevalent. --&gt; Ugh 😶 that's scary. People dealing with that stuff need to be good with washing their hands_chelsea I made a post on FB about the different ways our body’s react to pathogens. I’ll tag you. I understand that, but you still have to sneeze or cough for the virus to get onto a surface. So yes you can be a carrier and not actually be sick, but you still need a way for the virus to come out of you and onto surfaces."	0

@_KJKelly  I'm not at all suggesting that Covid-19 is just like the flu. It is clearly worse both in terms of transmission rates (R0) and mortality rates. But these charts are trying to show how it's an order of magnitude worse. Even with seasonal flu vaccine widely administered.  Yes, they do, though it is incomplete and provisional, as it can take months for all of the death certificate data to the CDC from the states. Here is chart of weekly pneumonia deaths  through April 4. Pneumonia deaths are spiking, as one would expect.   Source: Data for the week of April 5-11 is vey incomplete, so not plotted. It's already high, however. @_KJKelly  So week of Feb 1 total deaths 56589 (0 Covid-19); week of April 4 (highest Covid-19 deaths, 5457) total deaths 52992.So while Covid-19 ramps up the overall death count drops? @_KJKelly Final orders of magnitude won't be known for a LONG time. So much under counting of cases/deaths it's hard to tell and without testing everyone it's impossible to know for sure. It could still end up 5x or 10x worse than seasonal flu at the end of the day.  The flu vaccine doesn't affect SARS-CoV-2. If we had a vaccine, we wouldn't be on lockdown.	1
 _Dow  what are the symptoms of covid-19? Do you feel hard to breathe?50,000+ confirmed covid-19 infections in the US. Half of all confirmed cases are in New York state NYC now has more cases per capita than Italy And that's with very very limited testing. I was diagnosed with Covid but cannot even get tested. My kids have similar symptoms so I assume the 4 of us have it.  Stay strong, sir!_Dow  Thank you, much appreciated. Thankfully our symptoms have been mild so far, compared to some of the heartbreaking stories I've been reading. _Dow  Symptoms differ by person. Me, it's been high fever, more in evenings and night, bad headache, chills. Since 2-3 days ago, difficulty to breath. Kids have same, but milder.Nothing that warrants going to the ER at this point. Hoping it would stay that way.	0

No wonder the kids are turning into bullies. cruel to punish the kid. What is the lesson he is to learn? need educators with some finesse &amp; reason to solve issues of this type Couldn't this be considered a form of bullying? It is a shame in these days. if u gonna to do this to  a kid black or white at this age,he is going to hate u to the core. I'm throwing  the bullshit flag. What is wrong with the schools? Disgusting..total humiliation for this child. At least the community surrounded him and his family with love. Fire the principle. _rose - This isn't draconian at all.. that's so messed up. This is so sad and wrong! What harm this causes a child. Discipline way off at this s hool. 3tardies all car related, get ur butt up early or walk-geezum what a mean thing to do to him.Glad  everything worked out for them immediate tears! &amp; to listening to this being defended by the school district as, what did they say, a confidential learning area? That was cruel by the school thankfully there still good ppl with a good heart out there thanks to Kelly autos. God bless u. wow this is horrible.

Isolation and humiliation is NOT a way to educate children. Shame on the school but kudos to the community for helping to right a wrong poor little boy , I think those who punished this boy, should be punished.  I hope ALL school districts that have had a similar policy will amend it as well. How awful for that boy. Thank you to the community! WTF crazy school is this all involved should be fired! Social Isolation is a strong torture technique for young victims, North Korea uses this modality in schools as well, weird faculty.

Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.

However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

 Why do we need it?  What happens to the decades of teaching?Nearly every country in the world has hopped on the metric bandwagon. The U.S. is one of three holdouts.   Outside of science classes because to be functionally literate in science you must know your SI units or at least how to convert out of them.  And if you want to talk about a waste of instructional time, teaching unit conversions is it.  Only necessary because of the US antiquated system.  We through out the years of learning and teach the metric system in 5 minutes. That’s all it takes to learn because it is better. I want aliens to visit the US. But they would think our county alone is so dumb we can’t be with visiting. That is how important the metic system is.  We were taught the metric system in Florida. In the 4th grade. I think we’d fine.	0

Questions may arise around UKAS accreditation – do they meet ISO15189? No, but highly unlikely to achieve in such a short space of time. Is there integrated IT? In some cases. What is their role in serology? To ponder for the future.Private practice has been changing in recent years, so governance can be complicated – there are self-employed pathologists and privately employed scientists in private practice and NHS employed-pathologists and privately employed scientists in the public–private joint ventures.Regulation and accreditation in the NHS is broad and thorough. It is mirrored, though, across the private sector – CQC, GMC, HCPC, UKAS, NHSBT, SHOT and EQA. The regulatory burden is shared.Global shortages make procurement a dog-eat-dog world. Related pressures also meant that testing restrictions were in place. New programmes needed to be developed: lighthouse labs and the Francis Crick Institute are two great examples.QA layers for field labs: UK NEQAS, UKAS visits and visit check list: e.g. operational management, staffing, BCT, liability and indemnity, SOPs, trouble shooting, training, competencies, IQC, EQA, validation, transport, follow-up, sample and specimen reception, PPE and on and onNow running through community testing example of Brent and Harrow CCG. Service setup within a week of formal request and another CCG seeking the service. But, misunderstanding remains – 'Why can't it be like IKEA?' Understanding of labs and services needs to be more widespread.We’ve just closed a fascinating seminar on a hot topic – testing outside the NHS.

 Interesting hypothesis. What is the certainty % of the herd immunity assessment? Probability of second northeast wave this fall is extremely low?  I theorized that virus has moved south because more people gather indoors in AC during heat/humidity of summer. Are we seeing a large increase in cases in other large BLM protest areas? PA? NYC? NJ? Chicago? I haven’t checked but my suspicion would be no because I think the virus has already burned its way through the northeast. I don’t see it coming back.I cover that here if you’re interest Still Gompertz function here, you think? Regional outbreaks?  I think that all those Gompertz states are in the clear. Rest of the country still susceptible This is not my theory, this is work done by Nobel laureate Michael LevittSo far the data supports this theory. All we can do is follow the data and see where it takes us.	0

Thermal scanners CANNOT detect COVID-19Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature).They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare provider if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have a fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue.	0
  Contain the virus? That's impossible. You can contain the epidemic. That's something else entirely. How many have contracted the virus with no symptoms? What is herd immunity? What are actual mortality rates? What's the accuracy of testing now? Whats an immune system? How must you self quarantine?  You have to figure that out BEFORE  you come. It's called planning.  😉  Why didn't the Governor lock down the state before New Yorkers spread the virus around the country? That would have been called planning.  Wouldn't that be responsibility of each state tho?  Nobody should be traveling really unless an emergency... the US will never contain this virus if they don't limit travel, social distance better, wear masks, etc...	0

 might be more of a thing since the 2000s but it’s every game these days. what do you mean “envious of being part of that level of connection” by the way? envious of another club getting that result, of course but “level of connection”? Haha. Curious, do you ever join in with Sign On? not for me. would you join in with rent boys? The only Chelsea game I attended was the one where Zola got tactically subbed after you had a player sent off in the 1st half {we won 4-1}, sometime in the late 90s. I was in Kop pretty much middle. I don’t know how old that chant is but I don’t remember hearing it. I wouldn’t... sing it anyway. They’re not compatible chants — Sign On gets sung {inaccurately sung in a lot of places} because YNWA is a such fun song to sing. Churlish not admit that most neutrals watching the 4-0 Barca game aren’t envious of being a part of that level of connection. I mean an all encompassing ‘fun to sing, meaningful, world famous song that spills over and is mentioned in other sports’ kinda way. Sign On has been sung for decades and it’s so old now that the lyrics {before covid job losses} are out of date beyond all recognition... It doesn’t wind scousers up, it Just’s just funny when people from Burnley etc sing it to them. I almost pity rival fans who sing it. So to that end, I honestly believe that it’s just sung because they hear it at Anfield and Dortmund and Celtic etc, and vicariously want in.	0
"How does COVID-19 spread?Initially, experts believe the virus started out in animals in Wuhan, China; and was then transmitted to humans. The current version of the SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person-to-person, similar to the flu. This usually happens when a sick person coughs orWhat is COVID19?Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. They have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in Wuhan, China.The virus was previously termed “nCoV-2019”. At the beginning of 2020, the virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2, due to its similarities to the previousSARS-CoV. The disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the WHO as Coronavirus Disease 2019, or “COVID-19”.sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters).What are the symptoms of COVID-19?Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms can include:• Fever• Cough• Trouble breathing • Feeling tired• Muscle achesMost people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death.This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.When should I see a doctor?If you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID-19, call 937 (The Saudi MOH Service Center) immediately.You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days:• You lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about which areas are affected. This can be found on their website:  ncov/travelers/index.html• You had close contact with a person who has the virus – This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.If your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. They can tell you what to do and where to go.If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. The staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people.If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead.This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.How is COVID-19 treated?Most people with COVID-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. If you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""ICU"").There is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions; and make you as comfortable as possible, this is done through multiple ways, including external oxygen(e.g. oxygen mask), a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), and/or medication.Can COVID-19 be prevented?There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID-19:• Wash your hands with soap and water often. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going tothe bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.o If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.• Avoid touching your face (including your eyes, mouth, and nose) with your hands• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, and wash yourhands immediately after (as specified above).• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects andsurfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.• CDC does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.o Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 tohelp prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has COVID-19.• Stay home when you are sick, and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to COVID- 19.• Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.• Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID-19.If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:• Keep the sick person away from others – The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.• Use face masks – The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. If you are caring for the sick person,you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. This is especially important if the sick person cannot wear a mask.• Be extra careful around body fluids – If you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear adisposable face mask, gown, and gloves. If any bodily fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.• Clean often – It's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, tablets,and bathroom surfaces. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.• Wash hands – Wash your hands with soap and water often (as specified above)• You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding withother people or pets in your home. There is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contactwith people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.If there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. If this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.There are things you can do to prepare for this. For example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.This way you will be able to receive and share information easily.If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. While it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk.Where can I learn more?As we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. Check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself.You can also find more information about COVID-19 at thefollowing:• United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):• World Health Organization (WHO): • The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH): • Saudi MOH Coronavirus Service Center Number: 937• Saudi National Ambulance Hotline: 997"	0

Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.covid-19 myths vs truth You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiencyWhile wearing a medical mask during COVID19, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally.

"  If that is the case, then according to this section of WHO, they are seemingly not in agreement that passing on the virus by people not showing symptoms is at all at that level. ""Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?""And here is new work, as of March 16 in , using a modeling approach to show that ""undocumented infections"" (which are numerically more common than documented infections) were the original source of 79% of documented COVID-19 cases.  29/More evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID19, which I think we must now regard as the reality we are facing.

Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.

Statistics are pointless without meaning? p-value less than .05, I believe there's a significant difference.  The common denominator is Obama when it comes to death in America when he is gone we can begin to rebuild USA♥  So it's Obama's fault people are insane?  very interesting.

I'm sure that's why Obama's number is so high. Right? What would they do if we said we want to keep our guns to combat climatechange and the madness it's creating?  do not be deceived. there are 2 possible motives. 1) gun control 2) police state  Obama is bad omen  A pertinent comment on the increased violence under an islamic-inclined president,   BY THE NUMBERS ISLAMIST MUSLIMS KILL OBAMA FAITH DEADLIER THEN OBAMA !   not surprising - those presidents had a gun control act which was struck down in 2008 tcotNO, cultural rot &amp; O works to disarm law abiding citizens while making others soft targets!

     What is your plan then Jason? Do you want to open everything and let the virus just affect everyone? Herd immunity? By the way, I pay my taxes for the Welsh Government.We will not be able to continue easing restrictions if scenes like last night continue to happen. They threaten the health of people in Wales and undermine the sacrifices the majority of people have made during this ongoing crisis.  Step down you ego maniac, labour failing Wales   As much as I want the restrictions to ease I think our government is doing a far better job than Boris and his band of Merry idiots.   I agree with some of the restrictions, going down the beach is daft , but Drakeford is not helping the economy, it’s gone political now    🙄The Welsh Budget to fight Coronavirus👇The most generous business support package anywhere in the UK with rate relief / grant support worth over £1bn, and a £500m Economic Resilience Fund going beyond assistance offered in England, based on the needs of the Welsh economy.    But the money is from Westminster     I never said open everything up ?? But the scientists have said the end of a pandemic, will be through heard immunity?? It sure what you mean by taxes     I would say most people don't support herd immunity. Even the pm gave up on this when he realised that 500,000 could lose their lives. We lost a friend few weeks ago and it was really tough. Our taxes pay for everything, including Welsh govt.      Yes and we'll pay hell of a lot MORE to wales compared to England to pay for the dead economy after this lockdown      Herd immunity then?	0

"Sunday PSA, please read and share.What is herd immunity in Ontario for COVID? Based on  calculations, about 2.1%  with only 1 in 11 cases of COVID detected.Only 2.1% of population has had exposure = NO HERD IMMUNITY AND MUST BE CAREFUL!!Perhaps you think these calculations are theoretical and don't matter. But they align very well with what Swiss researchers have found-- 11.6 cases for every 1 case detected. Most of the population of Geneva remains unexposed despite large case number. PLEASE--Wash your hands, wear masks, keep as far away from others and limit interactions. All these actions will help to keep you, your family, your neighbours, and our healthcare system healthy!!So children are usually considered 'vectors of disease' and everyone believes that kids spread germs. But is this true for COVID? Could it be that kids are not the superspreaders we think they are?Summary work from Irish Health Technology group here.......and a link to the report they have published here 👇What's going on with younger kids? Are they breathing less volume on people (yes, they are smaller)? Talk less forcefully? Do they have less prolonged interaction with others compared to older kids? Or Is there something fundamentally different in their immune response?Well it looks like policies aimed at kids may have a lesser impact on transmission of coronavirus infections. Implications for school openings. Sick Kids Hospital in agreement.""Kids are not the super-spreaders"""	0

"  Under the ""How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?"" Section?  You do realise that it takes at least 2-3 weeks for any measures to make a difference right?  Ok, another twitter expert it seems. Have a word with the CMO, he’ll probably be well pleased with your input  Aren't you the Twitter expert? You clearly think that you know better than the science supporting the action of governments globally?  No. I observed that the measures Italy have put in place havent seemed to have made a difference. I haven’t made any statements about how long measures take. You have.  Ok well you should probably read this  then you may learn why they are having such issues in Italy.  That’s virtually the same advice on the Gov website. It’s just a Q&amp;A. It doesn’t explain “why Italy are having issues”  As I said incubation period is 1-14 days. Italy has been locked down since the 9th march (13 days) there will be cases coming in since before that. People won't be in hospital from day 1 of symptoms. Time Delay is the killer here. By the time it's visibly bad it will be too late.  Ah ok. And where can I find all that information on the link you gave me?  Right OK, so if the measures in Italy are successful then the death rate should be falling drastically over the next 2 days?  Hopefully... Although you would also need to know how long people are showing symptoms before they die. Point is we can't wait and need to try everything we can to stop the spread. Otherwise the NHS will be on its knees. Italy has more hospital beds per capita than us."	0

"Brain teaser: Assume that 5% of the population has COVID19 antibodies, and the serology test has a 95% accuracy (specificity=sensitivity=0.95). What is the probability p that I have antibodies if I test positive? (For bonus points explain your answer in comments) Not needed to respond the teaser.  hence the answer is the ""tricky"" d) (which I did not get, because I wasn't watching for strict inequalities and thought I was picking ""greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95"") 0.5 if you are a frequentist. If you are an hypochondriac Bayesian and you work in an hospital with COVID-19 patients, i.e., p(antibodies) &gt; 0.05, then the probability shifts towards 1. If you apply Bayes you get the same result. Of course, things change if you change the prior, but that is unrelated to frequentist vs. bayesian. Hint: Thomas Bayes would be of great help Strict inequalities. Prior and likelihood neutralize each other exactly P(covid=Y)=0.05 P(test=Y)=0.095 P(test=Y|covid=Y)=0.95 P(Covid=Y|test=Y)= P(test=Y|covid=Y) P(covid=Y) / P(test=Y) ; 0.95 0.05 / 0.095 = 0.5 I'm taking my chance and not reading the other replies beforehand. It's 50/50! 😱 We have two random binary variables: TST (good test) and ATB (antibodies present). Plus one observable: RES(ult). Given same specificity and sensitivity, we can assume both vars are independent (?) Thus, among four possible combinations of TST x ATB, we have two that lead to RES=positive, i.e., (TST and ATB) or (not TST and not ATB). P(TST,ATB)=P(not TST,not ATB)=0.0475. So, 50/50 between these two possibilities. 50%  400 person trial. 20 are positive. 380 negative. 361/380 of the negative test negative. 19/20 of the positive test positive.  But 19/380 negative test positive. Any positive test is 50/50 a true positive or false negative. If I test positive I am either a FP or a TP. The number of FPs is the number of negatives (95% of pop.) x the chance of misclassifying them (5%). The number of TPs is the number of positives (5% of the pop.) x the chance of correctly classifying them (95%). Hence, p=0.5. Cheeky answer categories! I'm always entertained by how similar Bayes' theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other. 50%  One of my first go-to questions while interviewing data science candidates True positives (TP): .95*5%False positives (FP): .05*95% =  TPp = TP/(TP+FP) = 50% But, here is the issue. I can say I have a magical prediction power. Simply, I predict a negative result for everybody. And I win over the lab test.... but I have zero sensitivity! None of the above. It is 50% =50%. Could use Bayes, but ppl don't understand that so do example:   Suppose 10k ppl tested.  at 5% incidence 500 have antibodies, 9500 don't.  .95*500 = 475 true positives.  0.05*9500 = 475 false negatives.  FN = TP so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0.5"	0

Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.Pls Don't panic people with fake news because it's not real All Facts are in these threads 	0

Should I be worried that I’ve seen more and more people thinking “what if covid 19 is just like the flu?” Even at 0.5% mortality, and with similar rates of infection as flu/cold, that’s 250k deaths + hospitals under stress I am someone who asked that question. Just trying to find a way to make sense of it. Is the difference the global scope? The mortality rate? The unknown unknowns! Yes! But I’ve seen a couple of non epidemiologists sort of wondering if the epidemiologists are wrong. This is precisely when you feel the lack is both state and trust in science the most.	1

"Tonight on the Late Show I've got  answering your Twitter questions like: ""What are the symptoms of Covid-19?"" and ""How much frosting is it medically safe to eat in one sitting?""_lynn43   Yes, it does!  I hope we get to the frosting question. That's something we definitely need to know right now.    in FL where I live, they SELL their delish buttercream frosting in the fridge. I’ve resisted, bt now may be the time. I doubt I’ll be round for the next plague! Oh, when I moved from BOS to ATL, I bought my home, as new Publix had just gone into a strip mall.Jonesin’ some  Question: Is it true that Jared is sitting on a  patent for a reusable Corona Virus test in Enema form?

Yes  Can COVID -19 be transmitted through Trump's thin skin?  I do not want to know the answer to the icing question.  Let’s not really destroy my happiness.  😂  Three tubs is perfectly normal right? Asking for a friend.  13.5g of sugar per pound of body weight is lethal to humans. That’s about 5lbs of sugar...or 8.5lbs of Frosting. ld50  Hey Stephen, wifey miss you running across the screen at the beginning of the show... Can you run across with fun &amp; excitement... I know it’s a small corner... LoL... chase your kid around the camera Kmsl ....  There is also invermectin used for parasites that’s giving good results!  How long can someone be a carrier of Coronavirus after contracting it?  How about ""how do we get Rudy Giuliani the medical attention he needs?""  Will the CDC issue guidelines for the disease that is in the White House?  i feel like, at this point, i need the answer to the second question more.  “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!”- *p. Trump  Jan 24  I love you Stephen you're so funny and keeps it real.  Can u add cheez wiz to that last question?  I miss the studio audience, too. Have you considered trying a Zoom virtual audience? I could never see your show live, so I would love the opportunity to be a part of your Zoom audience!  Stephen you look great at home!  Geez. I could have used the *frosting quota* info dayssss is ago...  Can you combine that with how many sugar cookies its medically safe to eat in one sitting as well?  Wouldn’t that depend on the flavor?Frosting, that is. Not the COVID-19.  Can’t wait for my souvenir signature from trump I am fine with him holding up millions of needed checks just so he can have his name on it.  Yes, the frosting.  If you had Kimmel, Corden, &amp; Fallon as guests on separate nights, and they each in turn had the other three as guests on separate nights, and so on, and so on...  at what point would you get to Piers Morgan?  Because that’s when I’m done!     i really need the frosting question. asking for a friend.  Too much frosting gave me a migraine and I puked 😬  Well now I'm in the mood to eat a sheet cake, Tina Fey-style.  So how much frosting can u eat in one sitting😳🤷‍♂️😝 Asking for a friend..😇😜   Just watched last night’s on utube. Yer getting the hang of it. Better this week  Thank you for asking the important questions Stephen.  My favourite ""Can 5G cause Coronavirus?"" This was a genuine question from a journalist.  Steven, where are our tax dollars going if the President isn’t taking this pandemic serious and is only focused on opening the government?  Stephen, we love you and LSSC, but the from home thing is just not working for us. It's cool. We'll be back when you are. Thanks for the effort.  I know it was deleted and reposted without the typo, but:""What are they, symptoms of COVID-19?""   Congratultion  Excellent monologue! 😅  Also how much toast is ok to eat in a day. Can you restart the count by changing the topping?  All the frosting is my recommendation.  Pawesome openimg! Very funny. Had just finished watching _Homeland &amp; was still on edge of my seat. U r very zen 2night. Suited my mood.Pls invite  on yr show.I “discovered” her yesterday, as did the USA!Pls keep doin’ what u r doin’—giving us much-needed solace😷  I made a Trump cake, is there too much frosting?   Now, I want frosting..., I thought I'd be a bad influence.  Please don't hug anyone,  ugh 🤮  Great show.  Are drive-thrus safe?  Sorry I can’t look at Dr. LaPook without thinking of the great Leslie Nielsen...   Will there be a second wave?  The advice given from this DrLaPook is too much for a normal person... sorry not going to wash my takeout food wrappers 😖  Who picks up the bags he leaves in the hallway?  Is it safe to watch  press conferences?  I think I had this in December...or a strain of it and I had already gotten flu shot and pneumonia shot as well  Maybe next time.. 😞  Thanks.. now you made the diabetic want some frosting😂  I found it unsettling that while talking to Dr. LaPook you took another alcohol drink in the middle of his explanation of potential life saving drugs!  This was disrespectful and inappropriate. Do you have some drinking problem where you must drink while broadcasting your show?  Fever, dry cough, a whole pint container as long as it’s the whipped kind.  Nutella instead. 😀  Ask him why I am starting to resemble my sourdough starter.  Great show tonight. Great guest!  Thank You  Some body said we have to wash our hands for 15 minutes? Is it right?  YouTube not showing notifications for ur videos 😞  I’m just going to assume the answer to the frosting one is “three or four tubs”. Thank you   If you eat the frosting while standing, it is exercise. Trembling with fear burns calories.  Tuesday night was Hilarious!  Your team is doing great job producing an entertaining show on the fly.  Sort of like replacing an airplane engine in flight.  I miss the live audience  a. Craving sweetsb. The whole thingYou’re welcome  Why was Dr. LaPook evasive in so many of his answers? Example: ""When can we hug again?"". Answer: ""Hugging is good for you.""  If viewers want evasion, we get that with Trump's press conferences. How about a good honest, ""I don't know.""? Unless this was satire it was wastedtime  Highlight of my week: I shave on Wednesdays. What's your highlight?  Bothered  me he said the drug  Trump  was pushing like a dealer with no scientific proof and  condemned by  the  AMA this Dr said  was part of the standard  protocol  in treating  patients  Maybe  this is a New York  thing I as a patient  would like  the right  to refuse it  Very good questions about covid19.  Thank you for bringing DrLaPook to your program.  I am getting tired of cooking but I have been afraid of ordering.  Now I feel a little more confident about deliveries.  In a graham cracker I would like to say as much as it takes...and don’t forget the tall glass of milk!  You should interview John Krasinski! He has this amazing show called SOME GOOD NEWS and I think he would be a great person to interview.  Thanks for doing your show.  I hope you can feel our laughter across the airwaves.  ❤️  I was able to watch Sam Hunt and Dave Matthews in my chair.  G.I. Jon has done so well that I couldn't think of anything to ask him.  He couldn't be betta'.  I have a question for Dr. LaPook. Why are they serving the ""Trump cocktail"" to Covoid patients at his hospital?  Can't wait to hear about the frosting thing!  It's for a friend...  I am on plaquenil for RA. Am I immune?  You might ask the doc how to fix this. 😁    Dr. My husband snores can I get the corona virus if he breathes on me?  Thank you from Canada for letting the world know how  is the worst  in history! Keep up your good work Stephen!  As much homemade buttercream frosting you can stomach before vomiting. (X-nay on canned) symptoms- many cough, fever, body aches, out of breath or none of the above. Cannot really know without a test. Everyone needs to be tested.  Dear Doctor, would it make Stephen and some first responders happier if he would invite them to Zoom/Skype in to be his audience? He could hear their responses and they would get a sweet preview of the show! Win/Win?  Great interview!  You may find this interesting...  More importantly, what was  looking at up and to his right...over and over during that interview?A clock?Another samurai sword?ESPN Highlights of the 11/10/99 game vs. the Rockets where he and Barkley got ejected? 😉LoveYaShaq  Would love to see John and the BAND do a song on zoom, miss seeing the whole band!!!  Stephen, thank you for the laughs each night. You are one of the few bright lights these days.  Enjoying A Late Show! Really like the ""home show""! And can hear and enjoy the musicians so much better! CBS is doing a great job to keep this all going forward!  These are important things to find out.  On your show you've mentioned you miss the audience; would it help at all if your viewers recorded their reactions, sent them in, were complied together in 1 file then played over the show taping?  I mean, I know it wouldn't help during recording since it's not live. But, at least, you'd know how people reacted (maybe).🙂💕  I can confirm from personal testing the answer to the second question is “more than 1 jar” Aaand now I want to instacart a frosting. natesfault  After just a few weeks our skies are clearer and the water is cleaner. Maybe we could plan to return to a different and better normal. betternormal   And there are dolphins swimming in the canals in Venice. That one really impressed me.

What a great pajama party!! 🤣  here.. you might need this.   Time you have Steve Martin redo his King Tut song. Born in a penthouse, moved to the Whitehouse, King Trump...  Hey Stephen you're great ask the doc about cures are the symptoms  Or  My phone is running out of geodatum and some guys tried to trip me in the woods near 711 looking for Walsh so I might not be able to tweet your site. Hug. Can I have another?  I have an answer regarding frosting.  Eat as much as you want as long as it’s not fake frosting, like the imposter, whipped cream.  It’s the cake you really have to be careful of.  In fact, I only eat the icing, buttercream, of course.  You are my mental medicine for this social distancing. I love seeing you. Don’t stop.  Can we please start asking more hard pressing questions. Keep this up and the number of Peabody Awards  gets will only be increasing.  Excellent, both people that tuned in were probably thrilled.  Peanut butter by the spoonful, what's the harm?  Icing. As much as you want until you barf. Just make sure the barfing is from the icing and not the daily presidential briefing. Oops, meant presidential rally. If determined from the briefing, keep icing.  Who’s the last person you shook hands with?  Giuliani.  He lied too  Is it ethical to ""try a mix"" of cocktail drugs on people?  How come donald trump refuses to wear a mask?  Is it true that gloves are immediately trash the second you touch something?  Should you EVER take hydrochloroquine for coronavirus?

It is like censorship, these freedoms were hard fought and easily lost.Wait and see where this ends up.

Due to the answer to one of the questions about the ways of protection against COVID_19, a big misunderstanding occured about using or not using Vitamin C. since the answer including the things which may be harmful like alcohol,smoking and herbal tea AND taking vitamin C, got viral in Iran. I wanted you to clarify the answer again. Is vitamin c useful to increase the quality of immune system or it is harmful in this case of COVID_19 Thanks for sharing. In Iran, we need the urgent intervention of the World Health Organization to prevent disaster.  This government has no crisis management at all.  I am absolutely appalled by the lack of measures put in place at train stations and airports across Europe. Strict checks should be in place at every large city for both departures and arrivals in order to mitigate the risk of virus carriers spreading the disease.

How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.What is COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Symptoms The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if theyeyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”	0
  Herd immunity was always the plan.  Johnson told us so loud and clear.  If 65,000 died along the way, not a problem apparently.  “A big moment for the country” says Hancock.  Couldn’t make this up  Don’t need a phd to know what herd immunity means.   It’s not a new concept. Boris Johnson said very early the plan was to “let it wash through the population”.   Today they’ve announced its now considered to be “in general circulation”.	0

The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. 	0

"  Q: Do you take this view to imply that we should abandon the concept of knowledge? If it isn’t valuable, why do we need it?Epistemologists: if a theory of knowledge can’t account for the non-instrumental, final value of knowledge [i.e answer the tertiary value problem] the value problem for knowledge is left unsolved I think knowledge itself lacks value, apart from its relation to other things it entails (like true belief). Which option is that?Maybe the problem is left unsolved, or maybe it’s trivially solved in some sense – unsure what to say here. Third option: there is no value problem!  If knowledge lacks value, that doesn't mean the concept of knowledge lacks value. If rocks lack value, the concept of rocks may still be worth retaining.""Knowledge"" may be a useful descriptive term to pick out a class of beliefs, regardless of the value of knowledge."	0
What is a novel coronavirus?A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.What is Coronavirus?Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Can humans become infected with a novel coronavirus of animal source?Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012.Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.  As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.What are the symptoms of someone infected It depends on the virus, but common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndromeCan coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person?Yes, some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household workplace, or health care centreIs there a vaccine for a novel coronavirus?When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed. It can take a number of years for a new vaccine to be developedWhat can I do to protect myself?Standard recommendations to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses include maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices  and avoiding close contact, when possible, with anyone showing symptoms.of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezingAre health workers at risk from a novel coronavirus?Yes, they can be, as health care workers come into contact with patients more often than the general public.	0

occupies several seats within this OMT. What is the scientific foundation of the OMT advice and what is the reason this ‘herd immunity’ like strategy was adopted?government deems the chosen strategy a success, or more specifically, that is the message the government tries to convey to the public. The government claims to have based their decision on sound scientific advice provided by the OMT. The Dutch centre for disease control (RIVM)..Technical Briefing March 18th An important key in resolving these questions was provided in the parliamentary technical briefing of March 18th 2020. In this briefing OMT chairman ...Jaap van Dissel presented the following (figure 1) that outlined the strategic options that were considered by the OMT.Figure 1, the 3 conceived COVID-19 pandemic control strategies The three considered strategic options:1. No interventions, a worst-case scenario, where the virus is allowed to spread freely (red);2. Maximum control, a mitigation scenario, where social distancing decelerates the spread (green);3. Lock-down, a containment scenario, where..mandatory isolation diminishes the spread (blue);had been evaluated using a model, for which to date no source code or parameters were made public. The lock-down scenario is kind of odd, it would have been expected that the post-maximum slope of this curve would be ...significantly steeper as compared to ‘no interventions’ curve. Surprisingly, here the slope is even shallower than the ‘maximum control’ slope. This suggests there is a feedback present, which decelerates the spread, in the model used to evaluate these strategic options. Simplified Epidemic ModellingEpidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease, a one-way transfer is considered, where persons transfer from one bin to the next. The rate at which persons transfer is described by ...a parameter. An example is the SEIR model this model considers four disease stages:1. Susceptible: persons that are susceptible to the pathogen, i.e., not immune;2. Exposed: persons that are exposed to the pathogen, but or not yet contagious;3. Infected: persons that can spread the pathogen;4. Recovered: persons that have recovered, i.e., immune;Figure 2, SEIR model containing four disease stages. The transfer rates govern how long a person remains in a specific disease stage, e.g., the duration of the infectious period is determined by parameters %delta and %gamma. Such a disease model does not directly consider adverse effects a disease may have, ...e.g., disability to death. The previously noted feedback present in the model results presented at the technical briefing, suggests there is a parallel route (figure 3) within the model used for... Figure 3, a parallel SEIR with a severe and asymptomatic  route. scenario discrimination. Such a parallel route, if it runs via asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, could provide for a path to recovered and therefore immune persons. The other route is comprised of symptomatic persons, which may require additional care. If the ...symptomatic persons are in their ‘infectious bin’ for a longer duration, as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly, i.e., a huge dampening effect. As the pathway through ...asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic dominates over symptomatic persons.This parallel SEIR model, when applied to the COVID-19 data available from Wuhan (narrow spike), would yield the following conclusions about the virus:1. was highly infectious (most infected people where not on the radar in Wuhan);2. could not easily be contained.Figure 4, Idealised SEIR-TTI model. Unfortunately, the parallel SEIR model is in a sense equivalent to a SEIR model that allows for track-trace-isolation (TTI) shown in figure 4. Ironically, that is what the Chinese actually did, they aggressively tracked, traced, and isolated infected and suspected persons. ...This essentially halts transmission, the ‘exposed bin’ is kept (nearly) empty.When the SEIR-TTI model is applied to the Wuhan data this would yield the following conclusions about the virus:1. was moderately infectious;2. TTI was very effective.The suspected actual used model is more involved, as it is comprised of several age levels, e.g., for each age cohort a more detailed SEIR-TTI equation is applied. When age separation is considered it may have appeared, based on Wuhan data that herd immunity could be build ...relatively cheaply and quickly by keeping younger people at work (as the R0 would be hugely overestimated, while the severity of the disease was hugely underestimated), while vulnerable people kept home. A costly mistake as it has turned out.For more details and references see (in Dutch): 	0

What is a coronavirus?Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 1/3Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

So another important data point to review each day is the percent positive of all patients tested, by PCR and Serology test types. What is “percent positive”? Out of the total number of Missourians tested, it is the percentage that have had a positive test result.For June 1, that percentage was 6.5% for PCR tests and 4% for Serology tests. You can also find a table showing how many tests were done each day in Missouri, and how many of those were positive. If you view that table, you will note that the number of positive tests daily has remained relatively stable, while the total number of tests daily has increased.That means the percentage of Missourians being diagnosed with COVID-19 is lowering.To view this information to help understand the full picture, visit  and select COVD-19 Dashboard.

" President Trump should spend more time “doing” and less time “complaining”. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking! I mean really, this guy is complaining about others complaining.   Now do the WHO, mainstream media, members of Congress, and governors. Please show us their attitude towards Coronavirus during that same timeframe.    Wait. He showed Fox News clips of CNN and MSNBC downplaying the virus? Weird.How is it he ""did nothing"" when he was called a racist for restricting travel from China?  Even Fauci, who the left seems to love, was saying it wasn't a threat to Americans, even after the ban.     Are you high?I already mentioned that Fauci, the darling of the left, was even saying at the time that it wasn't a threat here. As for the antibiotics, are you aware that the combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin has  been extremely effective in treating it?    In case you're having difficulty connecting the dots, azithromycin is an ANTIBIOTIC."	0

why are schools closing for a virus I literally do not get it...COVID-19 is just like the flu why are we flipping tables and setting fires for a virus that’s gonna spread whether we can control it or not?? HONESTLY I am wondering the same thing??? and like it is stressing me out that all these places are closing FOR WHAT it’s blown wayyyy out of proportion, I get trying to protect those who aren’t able to fight off a virus like it but the rest of us will be fine it’s so ridiculous🙄 I 100% get that!! but when you think about the flu or other viruses that are close or just as likely of killing someone with a suppressed immune system why weren’t we freaking out about that? Idk it just seems so blown out of proportion :/ To attempt to keep it from becoming like it is in Italy rignt now. Hospitals are overwhelmed there. Even though only 20% of the cases are hospitalized it’s still like 20 admissions per day. They had 300 cases just a week ago. It’s not super deadly but super contagious I think instead of closing they should just let people who are not healthy, old, immunocompromised, etc, leave and stay home from things without consequences. It seems much easier to do that than close everything for everyone It is being blown out of proportion. I think because there is no approved vaccine yet and it is seeming to spread pretty rapidly so it’s easier for panic to ensue.	1

 WHO: “Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?“Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.”Among the unknowns re COVID-19: how airborne is it? Not very much. Thought to be “spray” if through the air not floating around the same way influenza does. Most common route is thought to be touching things then your face. It can be detected in aerosols three hours later, according to a preprint. So that’s a concern.  Bottom line: Yes it’s possible to contract COVID-19 from the air, but that’s not the main concern.My coworker’s mother has been hospitalized for six weeks in Wuhan. Her caregiver (husband) didn’t contract it despite sharing air.	0
   The WHO says this How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around 1/. This is what we seen in china   People just walking and then collapsing?   I am in self isolation from trip to Italy but 2 days left and it will be 14 days since we got home. We are not sick just wondered could we still wake up tomarrow sick and collapse?   five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available   Yes however there have been cases recorded that are longer than 14 days. I would trust WHO they said the death rate was 2% and have now changed it to 3.4%   I know but here is the WHO web page and they are a very good source for information 	0

 That's what I dont understand. If NYC is saying 25% of people have had it (or whatever), what is stopping the other 75% getting it (or at least 35% before you get herd immunity) &amp; dying at a rate of c0.7%? There is zero logic to it, unless you believe the serology number is wrongFYI those engaging with my tweet re NZ: I am very convinced by Prof Michael Levitt’s logic in this interview- it’s a must watch.   Key takeaways: Covid infections are never exponential and infection rates start to slow quite quickly after a proportion of the population become infected. This suggests very strongly that immunity is being conferred. Mmm - feels like he is betting the farm on the fact there will be no second wave. If he's wrong, it's absolutely horrible. Well, the pattern of each local epidemic since the first 2 in China, on to South Korea, Iran and Italy have all been very similar. I think it’s very safe to assume that a population which has had that level of exposure of a London or New York won’t have a “second wave” Nothing. Did you listen to the whole interview? The slightly unpalatable truth is that there is a minimum level of infection and death needed to confer immunity in a population. He quantifies it as 4 weeks of “excess deaths” Here he was on March 30 telling us New York had turned the corner. 	0

Thx xo Nice gesture. however, it's funny how they were prepared so quickly.  Looks like jiggerypokery to me.  certainly the POTUS shows NO bias as to the SCOTUS 5-4 decision on Gay Marriage.  nothing against guys..but white house people are so bias! All on my dime!""ridiculus!!RT : White House is lit like a rainbow tonight in honor of the SCOTUSMarriage ruling.  ccp .

Obama is a homosexual and Michelle a Transgender so I guess this is their coming out party lights.  This country will not stand when it violates God's laws. No man is greater than God.  just?  that looks like CRAP!   Ugly and embarrassing,everyone islaughing at the silly house.😜  makes u.s. Look even weaker. Wow!  LoveWins  and this offends me. Please take it down.  SCOTUS is just another appendage of Obama's self fulfilling agenda. Can't they think for themselves? why is white house celebrating this with taxpayers money.  Unpresidential.  So much for three separate branches of government This is upsetting.The Capital is not used as political marketing for group but for all people.This is a joke.  great!  circo maroma y teatro al pueblo lo que pida aunque el tiempo pondrá a todos en su lugar color it all red for the blood in Chiraq!

"   the law? If so, do you understand what that means? It doesn't mean that everything the government does has to make everyone feel any certain way. It means that laws must be applied equally to all people. Which law is being applied unequally, as a result of the existence of these   Unless it's a majority, they can keep talking. Put it to a referendum. If the voters of a particular area want it taken down, they can say so. Otherwise, it should stay. The government should never allow the destruction, by the mob, of public or private property.   You appear to be conflating removal of statues by government action and by ""mob,"" as you put it.  This thread deals solely with the former.  Equality under the law is not subject to a vote by the majority.  I suspect you agree when it comes to the governmental taking of ...   ...  private property, restriction of gun rights, and whatever constitutional right floats your boat.  Using pro-slavery monuments to continue to intimidate or otherwise send a message to African Americans should not be permitted merely because a majority wishes to do so.   I thought this was about the mob, as that's what Matt said in his tweet. Anyway, it's a real stretch to say that something I'm against being left in place causes me to be unequal. Do you know that the equality mentioned in our founding documents refers to equal treatment under   statues?"	0

  That’s pretty close to herd immunity, which is about 60%. IFR here is about 0.3%, which is typical, so tough mountain spirit only goes so far. What is average age?Austrian ski resort Ischgl was one of the epicenters of SARSCoV2:- 1,473 tested (79% of population) in late April- 42.4% have antibodies- 6x higher than PCR tests- 85% asymptomatic- 9 hospitalizations, 2 deaths  Yes, although the article notes that 42.4% is still quite some way from herd immunity. Also, it hilariously mentions that the low rate of hospitalizations is due to the tough mountain spirit.   Yes, IFR of 0.26%.None of the newspaper articles link to the study so I can't see for myself, but tested subjects were:- 1,259 adults- 214 children (&lt;18)- 479 householdsInterestingly, only 27% of tested children have antibodies (42.4% overall).

Get this evil terrorist on trial &amp;execute him, militarily. Enough Have your tea party buddies talked to you about a job yet Allen? Obama has sent over a billion $ to the Palestinians and Islamists so far this yr. Guess who's money...? Taxpayers!! IMPEACHOBAMA Another example of how the Obama administration treats the ppl in the armed forces. As long as the terrorist gets what he needs. - Things are upside down in this country! Hasan needs to comply with Army Regs and shave that damn beard off, if not, bust him to PVT. Why is Army coddling him?   answers WHY we need a select committee. Spread the word.  it is awful but innocent until proven guilty in a court of law is still a basic pillar of our justice system Sixth Amendment Yes sir. What happened to reduction in grade to E-1 and forfeiture in other benefits under the UCMJ? The traitor's a Field Grade! God bless you, sir, for exposing this horrific atrocity. It makes my blood boil whats disgusting is making old people work till they're 67 to get benifits,yet giving benifits to a 20-30 yr old for not working      What a shame to treat our soldiers the govt does - they should give thisoney to the survivors.: Ft Hood shooter gets $278k but victims denied Army benefits. Disgusting waste of tax $  tcot military Wonder if Hassan used some of his $ to convert dollars to prison cash, i.e, cartons of cigarettes.  His canteen a/c full too. apalling  The FT Hood massacre needs to be categorized as Islamic Terrorism. Victims and families need the benefits and help!  Can we ""garnish"" Hassan's wages with some pork rinds?  FOOL! Not worth time splaing difference. Progs too stupid to understand.  Sir you are aware the UCMJ does not permit wage garnishment right? Mr West it was said that Obama will always look out for his Muslim Brothers before any other religion. How about giving our Soldiers a RAI$E? WORK PLACE VIOLENCE? SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILIES NO PURPLE HEARTS! GOD THIS IS ALL ABOUT MONEY ITS SICKENING  Send to Salvation Army. Or a food bank. NOT THE RED CROSS!!!!   Salvation Army, please. Red Cross have not performed well in past situations. Seems to be going well t Amen!  HE is the criminal, maniac after all!!!!  The man with the plan. Thank you sir. Was your salary garnished while you were being investigated for torture? I agree completely, Sir! How is that possible?Even as scandalous ""workplace violence,"" they should receive help from the army.Eone knowas Hasan shouldn't. That will make a tidy little sum for restitution to his victims. I read the reports about all scandals &amp; wonder if Americans are really listening.  I fear uninformed voters as much as big govt. Col, first thing the terrorist should've been was stripped of his rank so he could rot &amp; no terror or could benefit from pay. What is disgusting is the fact it was an act of terrorism not work place violence It will all be seized as part of the fine he'll get along with prison.   He can never use the money. And make Mr.idk call it 4 what it is A TERRORIST ATTACK.  Hasan gets $278k but victims denied Army benefits.tcot All the money in the treasury will not get him out of that wheelchair. He'll roll to the gallows.  tcot  The world is upside down! Please run for president &amp; try to get this country back on the right path to freedom!

What a fubar - Better yet, COL, send the money to the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home.  What do you plan to do about it?  - If the drag this out much longer he will be getting retirement.

the fear cant hurt you, not even when you are sick with covid-19.....so what is covid-19 gonna do? make me scared of dying and turning to my last resort which is GOD anyway. cmon why wait til the last minute and destroy the weapon of the devil which is fear.but I will live on...where will you spend your eternity existing, in a free and wonderful place...or in hell by believing the lies that its really the best place. hell is contrary to heaven. if hell is fire and brimstone, weeping, wailing, gnarling and gnashing of teethand a worm that eats you but never dies... like the maggots that feed off of rotting flesh....I wont be afraid of no covid-19, nor a heart attack, nor suffering, nor death as tho its a suffering.  I wont even fear my anxiety from my own brain disorder. the only one I revearthat I fear in reverence is the LORD our GOD.  because even the devil cant destroy a soul and body...but only a body...whats a body..this spirit is willing, and God willing so is the flesh. because fear is a prison. keeping us locked up, broke, an suffering cabin fever..fear harms the soul by keeping you busy from GOD to be greatful, and worship HIM rain or sunshine....worship HIM the creator of your spirit, which is your existance.  without Him your soul will suffer. or in otherwords covid-19 fear without realizing that there are more survivorsthan there are deaths.  look at all of you that are panicing and are puppets to the fear.and have a relationship with God.4fear of the unknown breeds hatred and kills or causes sin basically because you turn from GOD who is love, and has plans for every christian, not to harm you, but prosper you, to give you a hope and a future.

  _law Do you think the 350M are ready to accept a UBI? If the UBI is able to purchase basic food and housing, why do we need it? Why not remove money entirely? At what level of the collectives should a UBI be established? (Note: I have not said whether I am for or against a UBI.)  western people are somewhat confined to thinking about individuals instead of the systems that they are a part of, create, and sustain.sorry to be an ass about it, but if you don't understand this, you won't understand anything i say   I actually just watched that video fairly recently, at _law request. 💜To solve these sorts of problems, we definitely need systems thinking. I'm reasonably educated in this area.Also spent many years working in semiconductor, on SPC &amp; supply chain infrastructure.  _law I can see what you’re saying. Thank you. I think part of the issue is that I don’t think in hierarchies or boundaries. Why does “systems thinking” tend to go bigger instead of smaller?Person = rose (for now)Pedals = mindStem = bodyTo be continued. :)  _law What about:Washington state = rosePedals = citizen (person)Stem = government (people)United States = rose…North America = rose…World = roseEach pedal has its own needs (notice they don’t all fall at once). To your point, there is a supply chain…at every scale.  _law The original principle still applies. Some of the roses (for you) or pedals, or cells will be able to adapt - others won’t - trying to make reactions go faster though, tends to result in a smaller yield, I think.  _law almost all rose bushes can recover from mites, mold, and other vermin if they are properly fed and watered. their survivability is not an innate trait but an effect of the relationship with their environment/context.  _law what's failing is the system that arranged these 350 million this way (see: DJIA collapse, international travel rates and lockdowns, etc ).if we implement UBI so the 350m can buy their food reliably for 12 months, life will be peachy, but the oligarchy and corporatocracy won't  _law accept is a mental statewe need it because the current system of distribution (Fed loans to commercial loans to payrolls) is pretty much at a standstill and restarting will take a decade.each heartbeat gets a UBI  _law Reminds me of the Fiona Apple line: He said, “It’s all in your head.” I said, “So’s everything but he didn’t get it.” (State change = adaptation.)Okay. Let’s see how it goes over time. Would be interested in seeing how this group of humanity adapts to that.	0

   _Admin  What is the fuss about the herd immunity? How does the body of a person or for that matter a herd get to know the presence of the virus with out actually getting contracted?39,565 people screened till 4 pm today, by special teams constituted for the purpose. _Admin   _Admin  So the screening is restricted to checking temperature. I thought the team would be taking blood samples to test antibody for Corona virus.  _Admin  Its a different type of testing that I was talking about. Antibody testing checks if a person has already got immunity against the virus. This need not have to be done for the entire population but a small size to check if the population has developed herd immunity.   _Admin  The fuss can't be explained in 140  on Internet if interested to know more 😂	0

2. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. Thanks for the highlight may Allah see us through	0
45 has depleted the ranks of scientists prepared to control diseases with his hiring freeze. What are the symptoms of Covid-19 again...?  Gunky sore throat. Dry ineffective cough. Fever.

 Possibly;  but one has to ask oneself what is different now from before.  The virus is no different.  Large scale surveys tell us that not all that many in eg Spain have had it [7%?] so herd immunity very unlikely.  Maybe private social distancing is enough. Climate?  Unlikely.This article intrigued me.    So, unless I have missed reading something important, the early release of lockdown is precisely what is going to put us into the worst of both worlds.On the assumption that regulated social distancing has added to the economic cost paid up front, in that what we saw would not have happened with purely private social distancing...  if we release now without enough test trace isolate [sorry, very boring to continue to repeat]......then we'll have created a &gt; recession than needed for little gain, as we go back to a let the virus rip strategy.  What gain there will have been will have been purely about trimming the top off the 'curve' [ie reducing peak case load] and reducing mortality from lack of care. Seems like a second wave is modestly unlikely... Europe has returned without itSome US states have seen 'second wave' but really this is just first wave not properly reduced Major unknown factor for me in this is prior immunity from previous coronavirus exposureI can't make the evidence and theory fit otherwise, and proper epidemiologists like  don't rule this out  What have you read on that last point?	0
Q: Can eating garlic help prevent infection with 2019nCoV?A: Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from 2019-nCoVKnowTheFacts  It could help prevent infection unless everybody eats it, in which case any benefit will be lost.	0

"Pres. Obama on SanBernardino: ""We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel.""   A more effective solution is to get Baghdadi. He is behind this and ""gun control"" is not the answer. They used rifles._SS_49  she's clueless. I think she writes for Pennysaver. Thinks she's a journalist. Haha.  Yet another feckless response. then enforce that damn laws Mr. President! We dont need new ones that you won't enforce! oh, so guns are the problem. So why are the police called? They have guns. Stay alert here. Good people with guns kill bad people with Maybe if the gun laws were not so strict in California, someone could have protected themselves  USA!!! Once a place for dreams n hope!! Let's get back to that Country💯💔😢 Few social services,wealth disparity,and guns available everywhere -what can we expect from the desperate?  assault rifles are banned except to owners of special licenses, police, or the military.  this administration has made us a 3rd world country. No respect for human life.   they gave enough weapons for free with bank accounts in bowling for columbine, its no wonder why! ...hélas!!!!  if only California had tough gun laws....oh wait! it's all happening under your watch, it's probably what you wanted, so you can get your way a lot easier. hmmm Muslims ? how would he know? His record to date has not been great! why not make killing illegal? Put up signs saying ""no killing zone"" that'll work right? sarcasm  California has the most gun strict laws in American? yes it does! Media coverage!Remember the ""Road Rage"" in the 1990s?_V2    Shocking that the climate change pow wow in Paris didn't rebuke all this!  can this POS get any dumber!!!!  _666 you mean the president who has tried repeatedly to regulate military style weapons?  only since Obama was elected. Is her trying to generate a situation so he can use Executive Action to control guns? Except that he is president. maybe Media should stop glorifying the whakos. It just encourages more of them  Hmmm,,this from Paris, ,Deaf, dumb, and deliberately blind. it's gonna get to a point where future Presidents will just say, ""well, this shit happens."" We have saturated our country with assault weapons and the owners of said weapons are now assaulting the country.  There's something wrong with the US at its core that it produces so many monsters. Yes so what you going to do about it?  the amount of pandering this country does for Muslims also has no parallel.Sad the President always jumps face first into anything that can advance his political agenda,He make a fool of himself in Paris .  Why is he commenting on this when he has absolutely zero details on motive yet? FUBO Given the FBI reported that no one died at Sandy Hook in Newtown, CT in 2012, I'm hoping this will turn out to be more BS we need signs that state ""no gun zone!""That would stop it the people's Republic,wake up get carry &amp; conceal so that we may stop crap like this, there is not enough officers to cover everywhere.  Too easy to obtain a gun. - Thug Obama 'We have'. We?the Only 'we' you're a part of is those who seek to Control &amp;DESTROY America.guncontrol a Marxist LIE  No parallel is right! Americans of all races r disgracing this country! Over stupidest things imaginable!! IT'S A DAMN SHAME!!! but sadly, it is...it is the new normal.  and now he takes our guns the government should just stop making reasons to disarm the public.  how do we stop the pattern of this awful evil we don't think it's ordinary.  Does that help? really? You don't say. Oh um you didn't say. Do you even know or understand what you said? We the people don't think so... He does not know how to fix problems unless he is told to do so,he only takes care of his own. paper shovel,he has prove record of what If they find the shooters to be Muslim extremist, will he asked for the removal of all?

9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common coldAll Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.Thread about some popular myths on corona virus1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the bodyApplying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skinThese cannot kill viruses within the body!!2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at riskSARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirusCurrently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus7. Face masks protect against coronavirusDisposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.8. Hand dryers kill coronavirusHand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.10. Antibiotics kill coronavirusAntibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirusThermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasonsCOVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray. Shambho Mahadeva🙏      _kala59  _jr _IR _tinku 	1

 This guy is crazy.. Almost 40 million in cal. Not quite 6K deaths.. and have been dropping by the week? Cases should go up for herd immunity so more don’t die later? Where is the science? More die in car crashes? What is going on? The hospitals are prepared for an uptick. Crazy!!EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY: Indoor operations must shut down for restaurants, movie theaters, family entertainment centers, zoos, museums and more for 19 California counties. Here’s what you should know:    Propaganda. 1. Testing has increased x10=more cases 2. 99.5% of + people will not need a hospital 3. In order fight this, people have to get it. (Herd) this weakens the virus. 4. More deaths &amp; social issues have not even been reported yet. You quarantine the sick, not healthy. 🤓	0

"  Guarda la sezione ""What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?"" nelle FAQ per il pubblico e vedi tutti i suggerimenti che danno alle persone per ridurre al minimo il contagio  sì ho risposto in modo analogo anche io e concordo, ed è proprio posta male la domanda. Cmq è ulteriormente complesso perchè nn è banale nemmeno dire che il consensus sia ""la vera scienza"".  La domanda secondo me è assolutamente legittima. Non è che è posta male, ma indica davvero il dubbio che attanaglia molti. ""A chi devo fare riferimento?"", ""di chi mi devo fidare"", sono domande che si vedono molto spesso.  La comunità scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi è ciò che va' preso per riferimento, non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalità. A prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza.  ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia. Burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da 2 mesi. ""state a casa"" nn è un claim scientifico. E' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita. Non è scienza /  scienza è dire ""se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce"". Il ""quindi state a casa a qualunque costo"" non è scienza.  No. L'OMS ha detto che stare a casa è il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi. Non probabilmente. Lo hanno affermato con certezza. Ed è confermato dai numeri. Non lo dice Burioni, né nessun altro. Lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanità.  cmq no, è scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa è uccidere tutti gli esseri umani. Se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani. Partendo da lì, possiamo capire come il dire cosa ""minimizza"" nn serve mai a nulla.  Quindi secondo te l'OMS dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage? A che pro, se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chissà quanta gente è contagiata?  Se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio è l'isolamento sociale, se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione.  definisci ""migliore"". Nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna, e invece quello dovrebbero fare. Poi politica sceglie con loro ZITTI MENTRE SI SCEGLIE.  La politica anche è responsabile della ""intromissione"" degli scienziati, eh. Se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico, te ne stai lavando le mani.  ancora, nn cogli cosa intendo. Loro devono dire ""chiusura fabbrica impatta X su tassi di contagio"". Poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no, dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi, economici e sociali, dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori."	0

   _Maxwell_ What is herd immunity? Herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely.Will you keep wearing masks and limiting your trips out until there is a vaccine widely available?_Maxwell_ Yep. Viruses don't disappear. Just look at measles. Controlled, literally no cases in western world until anti-vaxers. Measles are making a come back. Virus didn't disappear, just waited for stupid people to not vaccinate. _Maxwell_ If vaccines work for the vaccinated, why does it matter if others choose to not vaccinate? If you're vaccines do not work then why bother with them at all?  _Maxwell_ Seriously?  No medical knowledge at all, eh?  What about those who can’t get vaccinated?  What about those who choose not to?  We eradicated diseases until people got complacent.  _Maxwell_ Plenty of medical knowledge here. I have reversed more medical conditions than most because I choose to be healthy. I make healthy choices. If you do not want to succumb to viruses help those who are sick get healthy. Contrary to popular belief it can be done.   _Maxwell_ Do some research in 2017 59 million people died worldwide. If you are conceived it is only natural that you will eventually die. No one is guaranteed one minute five years 30 years or a hundred years. That is life. The strong will survive. So be strong.	0

Im tired of people saying that covid-19 is just “like the flu” and that “heaps more people die with the flu” uhhh yeah duh but this virus that everyone is scared of is new! And its spreading like wildfire. We don’t have vaccines to prevent it.This type of virus is more fatal because it attaches to your lungs! Children, elderly and people who are immuno compromised most likely wont survive this! Its a progressive virus and it keeps on mutating. That is why people are scared cause it cant be stopped or controlled!	1

Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There are lots of other reasons for good hygiene around pets, though. Some common bacteria can pass between animals and people, such as E.coli and Salmonella. Washing your hands with soap and water can guard against them.Who is most at risk?In the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 8,422 people were infected and there were 916 deaths worldwide. The overall death rate for infected people was 11%. But for infected people 24 and younger, the death rate was just 1%, while for those aged 65+ it was 55%.In short, anyone can catch a virus. But the effect it will have on you, and how seriously ill you might become, can be dependent on several other factors.Older people and anyone with pre-existing medical conditions, like asthma, diabetes or heart disease, appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the new coronavirus, according to the WHO.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.Can gargling mouthwash protect you from infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.Some brands or mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth. However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection.The World Health Organization recommends taking the following precautions:1. Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water2. When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands3. Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough4. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your healthcare provider5. When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals6. The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.	0

Part 10Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, FREDIBOATPart 6How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. FREDIBOATPart 11many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  FREDIBOATPart 12WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    FREDIBOATPart 13Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this FREDIBOATPart 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. FREDIBOATPart 15Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eatingFREDIBOATPart 16What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. FREDIBOATPart 17Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularlyFREDIBOATfor the latest news.Part 18You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with FREDIBOATPart 20surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. FREDIBOATPart 21This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such asPart 22cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will FREDIBOATPart 23have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.FREDIBOATPart 24Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? FREDIBOATPart 25You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.**********Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for FREDIBOATPart 26everyone)Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or FREDIBOATPart 27to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 FREDIBOATPart 28Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.FREDIBOATPart 29How likely am I to catch COVID-19?The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places aroundPart 30the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure toPart 31comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in FREDIBOATPart 32China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.

  do you know what these results mean in the context of this chart?   Both domains of research are still in the theoretical phase. Dark Stars haven’t been observed, and Solar Axion is still a probability not yet fully tested. Also dark matter experiments on earth have to deal with gravity which somehow disturb the outcome.

Might not be a popular take, but if you want sports to happen anytime soon before next fall what is a viable option outside of herd immunity? Shutting everything down after a couple positive tests will last 3 days tops and then the leagues are done again.Not saying athletes should be forced into that, they then make their own decisions if they wanna opt in to that idea or not. And any means necessary reserve the best medical treatment for Russell Westbrook.	0

".:  Muslim comment ""disqualifies"" him from presidency      Ain't this whole thing gonna take a change when  backs someone.   that's a joke. Obama should be disqualified for lack of leadership!   Incredibly hilarious how they think this is law - White House does not 'decide' anything of the sort.    Does supporting terrorist sponsor Erdogan disqualify anyone from holding office in the US power structure?   Big deal, Trump leads and it keeps getting larger the more people talk.   Trump controls the media,    Josh, your boss is out of touch with World AND U.S. reality, resonating now, as does The Peanuts teacher.     I don't believe that is your decision to make   a scare tactic? He's the only&amp; best hope to restore Our country. Which will take more than 4yrs   Congratulations! USA he got exposed too early!   CNN stop reporting using 10 seconds, you should report full and complete story UNBIASED!Vote for Trump.   Who the fuck are you? Trump is protected by FREE SPEACH! Did you write the president rule book?   He is a racist very dangerous   مرحب   _vargaz   Well spoken but the Republican party would not take note   I think thats up to the voters to decide that  , not CNN.      Trump's words do NOT disqualify him! I don't see CNN or other Liberals trying to remove Obama or dq Hillary   I would have thought his idiocy would have disqualified him first.   we live in hope u correct.       Why is Press Secretary Josh Earnest LYING about POTUS eligibilty?     It means he can't fulfill the oath. It's not formal/enforceable, (1/2)   The comments of the HMFIC through Un-Earnest have absolutely no merit.    really rich coming from Josh Earnest.  Btw, does us constitution apply to ppl in foreign lands?   So you want Americans to only have an option between Hillary or Bernie. Very liberal tactic.  Trump supporter ... Nuff Said  😂   Riiiight   who says he wants to be president in the first place?   سري جدا :يتحرش بضيفته على المباشر  شاهد!!!:o   The Republican Party doesn't have my permission to broker my vote. My person drops I decide who gets it.   Трамп честно говорит то, о чём думает каждый, но боится признаться. Трамп - один честный политик в США.   LOLOL...Don't always agree with Mr. Trump, but appears more qualified than Mr.O.  At least he thinks.  Honest question: Aren't their any official restrictions that legally(!) disqualify a candidate who acts unconstitutionally?   Josh is as misinformed here as Obama is about gun control. Constitution applies only to US citizens.    why did y'all lie    allowing Muslims who support sharia in the United States disqualifies Obozo   If any one impose ban entering any country of World on Muslims or even talking abt will be brutally 💥💀👿🔫💣🔨🔪   Why on earth the White House want to change its colours? White is fine!   but yet  under federal investigation does not disqualify her? Gtfoh"	1

 2. How Does COVID-19 spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 probably emerged from an animal source, but is now spreading from person to person. The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)From respiratory (saliva, nasal mucus,) droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It also may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possiblThecommunityCoronaUpdate	0

Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.Pls Don't panic people with fake news because it's not real All Facts are in these threads 	0

Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  coronavirus coronovirusindiaQ. What is a CoronaVirus?A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. coronavirus coronavirusindiaQ. What is COVID-19?A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. coronavirusQ. How fatal is COVID-19?A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. CoronavirusOutbreak coronavirusindiaQ. How does COVID-19 spreads?A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. CoronaVirusUpdates[2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. CoronaAlert coronavirus[3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. coronavirusindiaQ. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?A.

"What am I trying to say? Everybody has their lane. That a particular trade is booming for someone you know does not mean it will boom for you. You do not know what they know. Forget the glamorous results you see, people's secret efforts settles most of these things outwardly.Many times you see many people post their achievements and accolades on social media and you say to yourself 'why not me?' When will it be my own turn? Do they have two heads? etc. No! Nothing is wrong with you. Just discover your own lane and press forward. YOU ARE YOU!!!Most people will not even write about their failures. I AM SUPER PROUD OF MY FAILURES. I failed forward. My failures gave me more lessons and earned me the right and boldness to teach other people about business.Your failures are a plus. You learn never to do things that same way. Reason I embraced the lean approach. I learnt how to start a business with a very little cost, validate and then grow it.  () is a clear example. I will tell the story some dayBy God's Grace (ALL GLORY TO GOD), doing my entrepreneurship career has gotten me recognition home and abroad including from President Obama through his Foundation, the Dutch Government, The Wharton School, Ventures Platform, Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria...Others are Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) - a network of 121 Vice Chancellors of African Universities, Federal Government of Nigeria, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)...Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Embassy of France in Nigeria, Bank of Industry, African Entrepreneurship Awards, Morocco, and several others.Because of my work as an entrepreneur, I have had FREE, and I mean COMPLETELY FREE trips to some countries in Africa and Europe. It looks like I am bragging but I am actually not.There were times I applied for these things - put myself forward, pushed and pushed and I always got a NO! For me to share one award, recognition or free travel that came my way, I may have gotten NOs in a multiple of 10, if not 20.There is a particular annual fellowship I have applied for every year from inception back to back for 6 times in 6 years. I will try again the 7th time this year and look forward to being selected. That is how it is.You have to develop a thick skin to getting NOs, see them as part of the process and forge ahead. You have to learn from your mistakes and pick up yourself quickly. You have to ultimately look for your own lane and run your race.Do not let anyone guilt trip you in believing that this life is a competition. We are not wired to do the same things. You also have to stay HUMBLE. Little accolades should not get to your head. If it does, your dreams are so small. Increase the elasticity.I moved to another city and drowned myself in Bishop David Oyedepo's book - UNDERSTANDING DIVINE DIRECTION. I tried applying for jobs during this period and never did I get one. See, I have a very great CV, good schools, excellent grades and awesome work experience.As at that time, I had worked for an Impact Accelerator and Consulting firm in Nairobi, did a three year stint in two large commercial banks with several volunteering experiences.The first test invite I got, I passed and was asked to stay back for an interview same day. I was equally successful and was called to see the CEO which was the last stage of the recruitment process. Maybe my price scared them, I was not called back as promised.The second one I ever got much later, I argued with my interviewer who felt he knew everything. LOL. I didn't get both jobs. Thank God. I am sure God was looking at me and shaking his head like ""see this boy I gave a master-plan trying to run the race of someone else"".Discover your own lane and that is where you will shine effortlessly. This does not in anyway downplay the part of hard work. You will work extra hard and even harder as you go up. Succeeding is easy. Staying successful is not.That does not mean you will not celebrate your wins. Celebrate them. Enjoy them. But you know what, move on quickly and do the same things you were doing even more.I HAVE MY STORY! YOU HAVE YOURS! They are never the same even though our results might be similar. It could even bring us plenty money and fame. But it is never the same.Finally, success is not even about the money and the fame alone. It is about living your life in a way that you feel happy and fulfilled. Only that, money makes the happiness and fulfillment sweeter. Just find your lane, stay there and run your race. Dazzol.Blessed weekend."	0

"   What is the appropriate case fatality rate then?  1.4% is reasonable.   What percentage do you think is required for herd immunity?  Even at 70%, the number dead is too high to contemplate w/o a vaccine: 3,2340,000.   Herd immunity will arrive long before a vaccine.  That would require 70-80% of the population to be exposed. And our healthcare infrastructure is certainly not prepared to deal with the consequences of that.   And I doubt most of us are ready for the rate of death that would accompany that rate of exposure (3.7 million dead assuming a 1.4% death rate and 80% of US population exposed  [330 million x 80% x 1.4%] exposure)(is my math right?).   1.4% is wrong.  Furthermore, you will not need an 80 percent infection rate to achieve this.   ""What is the appropriate case fatality rate then?  1.4% is reasonable.""Doubtful, because the true denominator is completely unknown.Also, cell immunity appears to play a large role.  Completely undetected through current testing.   You just say stuff, but you don't read the source I supplied, nor supply any of your own.  And to obtain cell immunity, you have to have had the virus already.  That's what the 70%-80% of people exposed get, cell immunity, one hopes."	0

Guess some people still haven't learnt  Trump can say anything, what's frightening is that there are a lot of Americans who believe him.  BOI	1

"U.S intel: Missile that hit MH17 was most likely fired by pro-Russian separatists. Details:    The rumors run around for the 48 hours, then it seems to settle down when facts come out.   Not to be gruesome but...where are the bodies (body parts)? A plane is blow up and there is not even a finger around? Hmmmm  All aircraft are vulnerable to missiles. Nothing at all to do with type of plane. Ridiculous statement ! MH17 MH370 哈哈，其实真相并不重要了，重要的是各方拿这个事怎么做文章。 なんで　罪のない人たちが　犠牲になるんだ？ロシアだろうがウクライナだろうが　関係なく　卑怯だ　これが　正義のための残酷だと言うのか？　  I can't believe ANYTHING I hear on the news, anymore. really???? ""Most likely"" it wasn't Switzerland come back in off that limb Highly unlikely,they can't afford that kind of weaponry nor do they have the technical expertise to use it,this is Russia's doing. It's sad to see US involved in starting yet another senseless war. This one in the Ukraine. airplane didn't explode in the air. If it was shot down it would have exploded in the air not on the ground  Ukranian gov't ordered this flight to lower its altitude, according to Reuters.  Why?  _ann  hi some pretty fast analysis, I'm sure they would never lie to the American people. Totally trustworthy with a great track record. GazaUnderAttack ! stop !  If a lie is repeated multiple times, for a stupid person becomes the truth, but... HAVE MERCY stop lying... you are USA""s agent. Um..we knew that already. Even Ukrainians don't fire at that altitude(!)  ...great, another moronic Putin apologists/propagandist.  LMAO...get a clue.

MH17 why haven't you said a single word about the appr.190 dutch victims? How sad! mh17 pilot flew west not normal day path... flt plan error. Route is near night flt.  Pilot error? Ok, so WHO gave them that missile launcher?? MH17 WAYNETRAIN ""most likely"" - are you kidding? where are proofs? how sure?your information about this MH17 is not stable,where is your proof?

Should worry about the US problems instead of other countries. They obviously found out by spying on pro-Russians well I hope so Russian Nazis did this backed by Putin with weapons and diversionists  The only sure thing is that there are 298 people died! R.I.P.  all debris in one place? But how can all matter did flight at one direction? flight mh17 vs. mh370 not found and hadn't been shoot?

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Let´s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let´s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here´s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization.CovidfreeAprilCovidfreePhilippinesCovidfreeWorldSome people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0

9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.2. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth).3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.	0

Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects such as letters or packagesecommerce  Absolutely the packages received from China will be safe from Coronavirus. As virus need food to survive because virus do not prepare its own food, it is dependent on food made by others.That's why when the virus enters in humany body we feel less energetic.Coronavirustruth Thank you This is exactly what I told my 27 year old step-daughter after she got a package from Wuhan.

Myth buster: Per the World Health Organization, 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19. Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. Share facts. OCCOVID19  Per the  it wasn’t person to person transmission either ....So which facts should we share ...the ones where they’re wrong or the ones where they’re right...and how do you know It’s so stupid We’re experiencing the effect of COVID-19. It’s an opportunity for us to see the message in this from Mother Nature. Maybe we can learn to live more lightly regardless of race or religion.

What is a coronavirus? Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS.The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19.I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.It's a Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A.What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.How does COVID-19 spread? People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.How likely am I to catch COVID-19? The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.Should I worry about COVID-19? Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized.Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.Should I wear a mask to protect myself? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.The mask can only be used once.If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? No. There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.Is there anything I should not do? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:1. Smoking2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 3. Wearing multiple masks 4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.CoronaAlert coronavirus CoronaOutbreakThread	0
   Are you kidding me?I never knew I had the power to deceive the world. It’s the truth that there is no evidence shows that the virus originated in a laboratory in China.

And then you lied about it and cost lives. Truth is truth. ChinaLiedPeopleDied.

Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No - the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. THREADWith a lot of misinformation circulating, we clear up some of the biggest misconceptions around the outbreak.Coronavirus myths debunked 👇 Can COVID19 be transmitted through mosquito bites?  No - the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads mainly through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. Can garlic keep you safe from COVID19? Garlic is a healthy food - but there's no evidence to suggest eating it protects you from the coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus only affect older people?Younger people also susceptible - people of all ages can be infected. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses.However if hospitalised, antibiotics may be given because bacterial co-infection is possible.

My grandmother watches Fox so she thinks the CoVID-19 is “just like the flu.” It’s 34x more deadly, 148x more deadly to people her age. Trump is waging a disinformation campaign instead of protecting the US. It’s infuriating. What a shame. It’s a shame for the people who will die or be affected by the economic fallout. I am lucky that my mama is right along with me, she gets it. She is frail, and I worry so much, but she is dug in, and is being vigilant. I reckon I can be grateful for that. Have you asked her about the COVFEFE-45 virus? He's so stupid he's trying to kill his own (aptly-named) base. I keep thinking that.	1

Part 16What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. FREDIBOATPart 17Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularlyFREDIBOATfor the latest news.Part 18You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with FREDIBOATPart 19droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many FREDIBOATPart 20surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. FREDIBOATPart 21This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such asPart 22cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will FREDIBOATPart 23have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.FREDIBOATPart 24Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? FREDIBOATPart 25You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.**********Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for FREDIBOATPart 26everyone)Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or FREDIBOATPart 27to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 FREDIBOATPart 28Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.FREDIBOATPart 29How likely am I to catch COVID-19?The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places aroundPart 30the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure toPart 31comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in FREDIBOATPart 32China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.You can see these at Part 28and other viruses.If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.	0

Anyone else in a hotspot, wondering if even takeout food is safe? I used to think it was but I’ve seen too many stories on Twitter of people that were super careful, somehow got covid &amp; they have no idea how. And IF takeout isn’t safe, then isn’t grocery delivery also unsafe? 😔_az I lived through the hotspot in Rockingham Co NH.  Worked in the hospital all that time and did quite a bit of curbside pickup for our favorite restaurants and had no problems.Even though we’ve cooled down here, I’m still not eating in restaurants. Eating IN an actual restaurant isn’t even on my long range radar. I think we’re in this hell for a long time to come. I’m honestly feeling like we have a whole year ahead of us._az Most evidence is that food is fine. I did do takeout even during the worst of it here. That’s what I thought too. But some credible stories of careful people not knowing how the hell they got covid is whacking me out. It’s confusing. I’m having a day.	0

The death recorded in Kano alone is on the high side.

If Boko Haram can become a business, what is COVID-19? Has any official statement being issued about the deaths ??_ihunze They are typing it. It will surprise you to know that some state governors that doesn't have a case of corvid-19 are praying fervently to even get 1 case.

I applaud Mike Lindell for helping our country during this crisis by using his factories to make 50,000 N95 masks A DAY (!!) for our health care workers in need. This is not political - and you should do some serious soul searching if this act of patriotism is triggering to you. This is absolutely NOT TRUE. He got a free national infomercial from the Virus-in-Chief. He’s planning on making some type of mask. That’s not N95, it’s a pillow cloth. Plus, the government is paying for this crap. BTW: his pillows are awful. They’re chopped up styrofoam.	0

 Maybe they don’t believe that wearing a mask helps. I wear a mask at work because it is required AND I wear them in public because it might slow the spread if I got infected. But still what is the mortality rate of non NH residents? Mortality rate for children? HerdImmunityThe hypocrisy of people saying “all lives matter” while acting in a way that shows all lives do not matter to them. ThingsYouShouldntFindFunny  They can believe what they like, but the evidence from studies is clear that face masks reduce the spread of COVID19.  Meh aggies ; I think the key thing it does is reduce the “off gassing” of infected droplets. Even N95’s are 100 % effective.	0

 Enough with trying to scare people. What is the fatality rate? Answer very low for our state. I believe more in HerdImmunity than the maskCOVID19 cases are again on the rise across the U.S. Wearing a mask in public tells people we come in contact with that we care about them and will take the steps necessary to protect them from COVID19.In Pennsylvania, masks are required in businesses. _Perillo  Move	0
_jasper_88 _rdc  Is COVID-19 airborne? I don’t think it is, but it would be good to confirm that. If it’s not, then contact is needed to contract it. If we take precautionary hygiene actions, it will help reduce it’s spread. I’d like incoming travel to stop temporarily. Oz has natural quarantine._jasper_88 _rdc  Twitter's newsfeed says Australians are being told not to fly overseas, and the threat level is the highest in history.  True? _rdc  yes it's true, although I still can not understand why schools are going to be open._rdc _jasper_88  ScoMo? I think the facts support him though, very few cases of kids with it. They could be carriers without symptoms. _rdc  Possibly, but what about the domino effect, example if one of them came near my mum she would die due to her health issues. The kids are more resilient but others are not. That's my thinking. _rdc  Personally I am thinking it is, why else is it spreading like wildfire also it would have just been contained in Wuhan.. I may be wrong but that's my view._jasper_88  _rdc YES!  It is airborne and much of the spreading is due to that. We're told to stay a MINIMUM of 3 feet (~1 meter) from other people, and 6 feet is strongly recommended.  When you cough it easily travels 3 feet, 6 feet for a deep cough.  NEVER touch your face.	0

Should I wear a mask to protect myself? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.The mask can only be used once.If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms.Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized.Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? No. There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.Is there anything I should not do? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:1. Smoking2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 3. Wearing multiple masks 4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.CoronaAlert coronavirus CoronaOutbreakThread	0

Because he doesn't hate gays any more than Kim Davis does. But, he does believe marriage is one man and one woman. Pope seems like he is a great guy.

Amazing to think that just three years ago Barack Obama was against this until his re-election campaign needed a jolt, isn't it? that is so cool and shows such good support for our country! How long did it take to properly set up the lights with colors, from a time before the decision was made public?  Bruce Jenner would get 40% of the vote for President. Americans are dumbed down big time.   Another victory for President Obama and freedom loving people! Keep it going...I love it! everyone has the right to love whom ever they'dlike.  But the White House is a political free zone. Come on POTUS. High five BTW  Amazing sight to see President Obama singing Amazing Grace today. And singing very well.

"A short thread on evidence and our responsibility as healthcare professionals. ""5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19""This is a REAL myth buster infographic by the .In fact, it's the very first infographic that's listed under the section ""Advice for Public"". Here's another one fighting against the myth that garlic prevents infection.  These myths might seem absurd to many of us.It's clear though that this kind of misinformation continues to circulate widely (and maybe not in the groups that we are a part of). As a healthcare community, we need to re-establish ourselves as the voices of reason. Where this starts, however, is with independent and critical appraisal of the best available evidence by each and every one of us.The media (and that includes reputable sources) will continue to simplify and sensationalize scientific news.Indiscriminate sharing of articles summarizing papers and posts with one-liners from abstracts only perpetuates and validates this.If we aren't reading the papers and pointing out flaws in internal and external validities, who will?And most importantly, if we aren't appraising and translating the evidence into something the public can understand, who will?We need to continue to support and strengthen the voices of those who take the time to provide balanced assessments through this unique time.

Richest man in china just donated 500,000 test kits to the US. Trump looks so bad at this point. His incompetence is unreal.   Laughable. The only people who need to get tested are those at risk for respiratory problems. Your panic and fear are dragging mankind into the gutter.   Actually there have been numerous cases of healthy young individuals with no comorbidities contracting the virus and dying. It is a misconception that only the old and sick are affected. Also: Italy didn’t take it very seriously in the beginning and look where they are now   Citation needed   Yes I agree that those who are elderly and are immunocompromised are definitely at greater risk, but it is inaccurate to say that only those who have respiratory illnesses need to get tested."	0

  The worst of what?  What is covid-19?   There isnt dispute that 90% of healthy people recover so what are we talking about? Hospitals arent overrun.  We arent over the worst of What?One thing I think we've learned about the COVID-19 data is that we should not declare that we've passed the peak based on 2-3 days of data. And yet, every week, Sat-Mon, I watch people declare that the worst is over.    I guess 45,000 people dead in 7 weeks in the US and it’s not stopping any time soon- it’s getting ramped up here in KY....   45,000 people died last year in the US in 7 weeks and that hasn't stopped.

We have touched half a million. And we are doing nearly 20K new cases per day.And the government has been really quiet for sometime. What is our plan? Herd immunity?  Country. Chanting coro-nil, coro-nil repeatedly should reduce the cases to nil, right?😷 Luckily we have a cure, unlike other countries :) The initial lockdown was used to build up hospital capacity and resources-ppes, medicines, beds, ventilators. I think, now the plan is to open it all and see what happens. Our country can't afford many lockdowns. Atma nirbhar bharat. DIY. With respect sir, can herd immunity be called a plan for a population of 1.3 billion? Sweden also seems to failing spectacularly in terms of deaths but sticking to its guns wrt herd immunity! For herd immunity in India, at least 750M people would have to get infected. We are not even close to it. Only way out. India should be fine!

What company and product is Ohio using for the antibody tests that  mentions?    Ohio separates this. Confirmed = viral test. Antibody tests would be noted as ""probable"" cases if they are linked to a positive case or had symptoms based on an interview with a health worker. Ohio's ""total tested"" number put out each day does NOT include antibody tests.

However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. Q: Is it safe to receive a letter✉️ or a package📦 from China?A: Yes, it is safe.

Q: Does drinking alcohol prevent the new coronavirus?A: No, drinking alcohol does not protect you from 2019-nCoV infection.

In the race to stop the spread of COVID-19, some are wondering if HerdImmunity is the answer. But what is that exactly?Here's what things look like now: For this to work, 70 percent of the population would need to have immunity. That's 229,767,666 people in the U.S. alone. Scientists reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious COVID-19 is specifically. This is called R0 value. It measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect. This is how COVID-19's R0 values compare to other diseases. Even though the numbers are high and it may seem simple at first glance, most scientists aren't onboard with relying on HerdImmunity. Why? This tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the U.S. and 30 million around the world. That's millions too many. Until a vaccine can provide widespread immunity, communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable, especially heading into the fall, when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain. The alternative would be devastating.Experts also noted that by social distancing, we can mimic this tactic. Staying six feet away from others also prevents the virus from bouncing to a new person.Interested in learning more about COVID-19 and HerdImmunity?  has more here⤵️Here's what that looks like: 	0

9.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.Bisakah tertular CoVID-19  dari orang yang tidak memiliki gejala? Cara utama penyebaran penyakit ini adalah melalui percikan/droplet yang dikeluarkan oleh seseorang yang batuk. Risiko terkena COVID-19 dari seseorang tanpa gejala sama sekali sangat rendah.However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.Namun, banyak orang dengan COVID-19 hanya mengalami gejala ringan. Ini sebenarnya pada tahap awal penyakit. Karena itu dimungkinkan untuk tertular COVID-19 dari seseorang yang, misalnya, hanya batuk ringan dan tidak merasa sakit.	0

Part 13Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this FREDIBOATPart 9Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”Part 10Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, FREDIBOATPart 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. FREDIBOATPart 15Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eatingFREDIBOATPart 16What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. FREDIBOATPart 17Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularlyFREDIBOATfor the latest news.Part 18You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with FREDIBOATPart 19droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many FREDIBOATPart 20surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. FREDIBOATPart 21This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such asPart 22cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will FREDIBOATPart 23have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.FREDIBOATPart 24Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? FREDIBOATPart 25You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.**********Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for FREDIBOATPart 26everyone)Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or FREDIBOATPart 27to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 FREDIBOATPart 28Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.FREDIBOATPart 29How likely am I to catch COVID-19?The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places aroundPart 30the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure toPart 31comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in FREDIBOATPart 32China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.

The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.Just as fast as the virus has spread so has the misinformation surrounding COVID - 19 which can be equally as harmful. In this thread you’ll find many of the popular theories debunked as outlined by the  .5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. COVID-19 is spread through respiratoatry droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks.Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)Evidenced by the surge here at home you can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is.

"  sigh.  I'd like to see an official statement- specifically stating whether they bought photos, paid for trip, etc.  but he did get paid by his fund But speculation &amp; hysteria are the national passtime! I just wanna see you on  tomorrow. ;) OkThanks for this clarificationMT  CNN producer I talked to said doubted they paid. Cred got it // you mean it wasn't 's gentle rub and tug?. In fairness to , he reported Brown ""was involved with"" 2nd degree murder. Much more vague and irresponsible.  Wait.  You act as if payment isn't a routine thing.  Why?    no one can get financial aid for school with a criminal record!!!   just bloody wrong    We have Blacks in the news that know how to investigate. Let them do their job and report the truth.  Is that where this thing I keep seeing in tweets that Wilson is taken care of for life is coming from??: agreed. news, as you know, doesn't pay for interviews.  But there are other, more oblique ways subjects are compensated  yes...extensive emphasis on Wilson...info on the physical evidence was ""hidden"" in the coverage...hard to find. Wilson said he wasn't paid.     ABC won't make a definitive public statement though. Why?  my understanding was that ABC said they don't pay for interviews, not that they didn't compensate Wilson somehow.  the CNN producer I talked to said he doubted they paid. No 1 morning show cred got it. It's always the fringe benefits...Luxury honeymoon in NYC compliments of , now that's a ScandalABC!   Wesley Lowery seeking credible reporting? ROTFLMAO!!!    Post Michael Brown's criminal record. I dare you.“: tweets Darren Wilson paid by ABC for interview. ABC told  not true &amp; I've seen no credible report to contrary”  children who come from homes with domestic violence are more prone to violence. truth why won't you believe the conspiracy man? the facts are out there  disagree. real journalists research every lead but don't report irrelevant facts to get attention  look to JJ Harper. Karma     reading through this thread shows the crazy crackpotedness  that the media has fostered. Embarrassing. Dangerous. wow. Missed that along the way   Was he paid for photos?  Well he can't exactly go back to work now, can he? Who cares if they paid him? He didn't ask for all this?  I agree. ABC needs to come clean. Did they pay anything, if so, for what. They're being silly right now.  ABC has a rep for this kind of thing. Rather than paying for interview, they'll ""license"" a family photo. two extremely bad reports guy must be in line for the razzies of journalism. I can't recall so many inaccurate...or worse...posts over a story.  Especially on fb.  Well let's hope its not true because Shonda Rhimes cant save them from the backlash.   avoid triple negatives. You've seen no evidence her was paid? ""News"" pays for photos etc. Avoids direct payment.  Alternet?  Yeah that source has definitely lost credibility.   Yeah right, networks don't pay 4 interviews but it's a shell game, pay for use of images instead   Why shouldn't he give the interview to the highest bidder. ABC won.  Is routine. But everyone, on both sides, have denied payment. (but see my prior RT from )   progressives dismiss actual facts (GJ evidence, autopsy) and make up facts. Nothing new.  Maybe ABC paid 1 million for the shaving cut that he got😡   ABC added to the problem.  Didn't need to hear from him so soon!  Anderson Cooper tweeted that he met with Wilson when wilson was intv shopping. What made him pick abc if not $$$"	1

 So the deposit insurance..why do we need it?Its not a bureaucratic issue. Many of them r quite bright - its a political directions issue The real political decision to be taken is - how much and how to finance? How much - for India, anythng less than 3-4% of GDP wud be useless. Tht's abt $100bn - shd be splashed out purely on consumption, income support and SME credit.How to finance? Good news - pvt investment is going to collapse anyway, so some headroom wud be there in savings. Bad news - w/the lockdown, money multiplier⬇️-&gt; Savings⬇️ -&gt; headline itself will be constrained. Alternative - RBI buys G-Sec. Even deficit financing - its not porn.There is the added benefit of lower oil - adjusted for $ appreciation + drop in demand - it shd still be a good $10-15bn. W/almost ALL our public debt financed locally, we have substantial fiscal policy freedom. Time to use it for Indians, instead of saving it for rating agenciesLast but not least, stability of financial system has to be maintained. Tons of tools in tht kit - but the real one is simple - prevent a bank run. There is an easy soln - for the next 6 mths, nationalise ALL bank depos. Not the banks, but extend sovereign g'tee to depos..  Simple phsycological ploy to avoid any potential bank run till crisis subsides..... Last thing any government wants in this situation.....	0

".:""The number of ppl killed by mass shootings during Obama’s tenure is 424 casualties…Paris this year alone has 508 casualties.""  another way of saying that: look how many women have died since Gerald Ford was president  Wow... Great achievement for Obama..  Libs keep touting that there's been over 300 mass shootings in US this year. Wonder where they get their info.  No, can't be.  sez only US has a pattern of mass violence. But this is guy who said ISIS is contained.  Those weren't pipe bombs!!! They were a science project!  let's just build a wall around California, Illinois, and DC and see who comes out on top in a year.  MoreObamaLies  and how many in America were gang related? Bet a majority. But again Libs do nothing about gang violence/crime.    Contrary to Obamas declaration about it doesn't happen like this in other countries  Bullshit. Rampage victims in america vs. Overall homicides in a terrorized city? Try comparing apples to apples.  I was lking at the stats any the 1 I saw had every country with more ms shootings per cap had stricter gun regs  Oh but it is climate change and guns he will say.  Obama not having  facts or stats correct is nothing new for Obonehead. He is a well dressed snake oil salesman.  impeach Obama! I know it won't happen. That would certainly fix a lot of our problems!  Last sentence.  Thought for the day.     Ohhh but haven't you heard Laura?, these things only happen in the USA, according to the Huckster-in-Chief.  Wow.  Paris needs to pass some gun control laws.  obamas clueless! !  Get em OUT !  So there it is,Mr.President.Facts,are stubborn   thanks for sharing.  its far more than that chicago has more than that by there selfs Apparently you don't know. John Lott is a source.  ENEMY IN THE WH   where do you have the data on mass shootings in Paris from? Do you add vounded and killed in Paris? How many people have been killed by illegal aliens since Obama took office?   But America is the only place to have gun violence. Right? However could that be   Laura, assuming by ""casualties"" he means injured/killed, we are over 2000 due to mass shootings in 2015 alone  what's your source?  Dem weasel words-”Gun Violence”. Criminal Violence–Yes, Islamic Terror–Yes. Dems can’t call anything what it is."	1

" And because he keeps saying things like that, there are still a lot of people that think that COVID-19 _is_ just like the flu. They are unable or unwilling to think about the numbers.“We’ve never closed down the country for the flu,” Trump said last week. “So you say to yourself, what is this all about?”- President Imbecile. It's like the bs ""we have xxxxx amount of traffic deaths in a year so what's the big"" etcnot all in one country.not in a month's time.The numbers are surpassing the numbers from _all_three_world_wars_plus_Vietnam.People cannot imagine such a thing, such  deathnumbers. and no-one's talking about warm, damp weather coming. We have frickin' open-air morgues now. He's been bad longtime. But after accusing doctors and nurses of stealing masks...that's it. no one can explain that to me.he is inhuman. Subhuman. A demon."	1
With  reporting the largest single-day increase in COVID19 infections, with more than 183,000 in the last 24 hours and the U.S. accounting for 36,617 of them, I seriously think we need to consider tightening publichealth measures again, otherwise we will never control this	0
"Q: Could ibuprofen worsen disease for people with COVID19?A: Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of of ibuprofen.   _Europe     How to believe WHO?  See this January 15 info of WHO    _Europe     They can only go on the data that's available at the time. ""No clear evidence"" of something doesn't mean it's definitely not happening, just that they don't have scientific proof of it. The science changes as we gather more data - that's to be expected  _Europe     It would be helpful if . didn't use double-negatives to get out important messages / notices. Thanks.  _Europe     Kind of a double negative here in your 1st post. Are you saying IT IS OK TO USE IBUPROFEN?  The 2nd post makes it seem like you’re consulting Physicians.  _Europe     I love ibuprofen. no one should ruin its' reputation :')_770   _Europe     It complicates the illness  _Europe     How many double negatives can you have to make this more unclear to lessen understanding?  _Europe     QUESTION: Will this virus come in waves over the next 18 months like the 1918 influenza did?  _Europe     many effective alternatives to ibuprofenuntil further studies are forthcoming...why take a chance?  _Europe     Except for people with diabetes and hypertension. There is research to indicate Ibroprofen can exacerbate the uptake of the virus.   _Europe     Thanks!Many governments seem to taken for granted that is is harmful though, maybe is there no general agreement on this  _Europe     Why do you use ibuprofen when it's not an antivirus.  _Europe     human pathogenic coronaviruses bind target cells together using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can be increased by treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers. Aka IBUPROFEN  _Europe     Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19,” Lei Fang, MD, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in the department of biomedicine at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland  _Europe     Because this question has come up: For people with heart disease (prior heart attack, stroke, heart bypass or coronary stents) who are taking baby Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA 81 mg), please don't stop taking it because of COVID-19 fears 1/2  _Europe     2/2 there is no evidence whatsoever that baby Aspirin puts you at risk with COVID-19.  _Europe     Despite the double negative, if you read the entire statement the gist of the  recommendation  can be understood.  It is OK  to use Ibuprofen if no other contra-Indications exist. Based on available information, this seems to be very reasonable.   _Europe     ""Based on currently available information.."" is unhelpful. It's a very broad okay for a very specific question. ibuprofen ibuprofene   _Europe     It looks like a lab strain someone is trying to patent to have a science vendor sell. Its an “attenuated” virus, meaning it’s a weakened form not able to cause infection. We need these types of things to make studying the virus easier in a lab setting.  _Europe     Thanks for the clarity, Ibuprofen is a commonly used drug so this helps   _Europe     But for me, my VA primary does say to avoid ibuprofen &amp; naproxen sodium. Check with your provider.  _Europe     . I wanted to pass this along to you. It looks like the WHO is *not* asking people to stop taking ibuprofen. Hope this is further help to you guys!   _Europe     Thank you!  We stopped the ibuprofen, sticking with tylenol.  _Europe     Please avoid using double-negatives in your messaging. That confuses the public, especially those for whom English is no their first language. Thank you for all you are doing in this pandemic.   _Europe     Thanks for letting us know that’s it’s not not ok  _Europe     We will use Tylenol for now and not Advil / Ibuprofen just in case!  _Europe     Our local media was saying different thing.  _Europe     WHO wants a future where only English majors have survived.  _Europe     Clunky wording with an unfortunate typo thrown in too. These messages need to be clear and understood. ProofRead  _Europe     Apparently there have been baseless reports, with no evidence to back them up, suggesting people stop their prescribed ACEI and ARB meds.  needs to crack down on those and stop misinformation &amp; FakeNews   _Europe     I'm contemplating stopping the use of Lisinopril, which is an ACE Inhibitor.  I'm so confused.  _Europe     Here are some myths about coronavirus that you must be aware of.COVID2019india CoronavirusOutbreak CoronaVirusUpdate COVID19 coronavirusindia Covid_19 CoronavirusPandemic CoronaOutbreak ChineseVirus COVID2019  _Europe     A response in plain language would help avoid confusion. I recommend against WHO copywriters. Ibuprofen grammar  _Europe     Ibuprofen is known to cause severe complications in any viral diseases like dengue &amp; flu. In sometime WHO would issue an advisory against the use of ibuprofen in COVID. It adversely affects the platelets &amp; kidneys as well !!   _Europe     Wow😂   _Europe     Kenapa cuman ibu profen ya? Atau karenaa kemarin kemarin menjadi apa yang di gadang2 buat nanganin demam panas penderita??  _Europe     Where can I find a link to this on the WHO website?  The search on the website didn't bring up anything on ibuprofen, there's so much information on there  _Europe      unroll Your Tweet was quoted in an article by     _Europe     ICTV based on taxonomy has determined that it belongs to the same species as the SARS virus, so they name the virus「SARS-CoV-2」A serious SARS outbreak in China 2003, and china guarantee to the ppl it  will not happen again. You cover and pleasing China by naming it COVID-19？    _Europe     The virus is called SARS-COV-2.The disease is called COVID-19.There is no cover up.  _Europe     Hi  my friend  says that a gathering of less than 5 people is harmless can you please tell me if that’s true? askWHO   _Europe      Not a doctor, but just use Zoom or something  _Europe     Can we get that in human terms plz &amp; TY.  _Europe     Poor wording: ""WHO does not recommend against"" can confuse many people.  _Europe     What if we don't have the disease, I'm having cramps, what do I do¿ Your Tweet was quoted in an article by     _Europe     I wonder why people will ever trust you after this. You said human to human transmission wasn't possible in COVID2019. What happened there?  _Europe     Get this awareness song. Stay safe, this too shall pass.   _Europe     There are medical reports of covid19 patients locally treated with ibuprofen got better situation slower then the ones that don't! It must do something...  _Europe     How can I find the daily situation report easily on twitter, we are at report 58 please tag them accordingly! Thanks  _Europe     Can I take medication for the mild simptoms, eg fever etc.  _Europe     What about anti inflammatory my husband and myself are on it  _Europe     DO NOT TAKE IBUPROFEN (Advil or Motrin) - especially younger people. Take Acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead. Terrible advice by  again...   _Europe     And what about azithromycin &amp; HCQ?  _Europe     What about ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) used for hypertension?Is there a risk of fatal COVID19 associated with lisinopril?Kindly clarify  Thanks.  _Europe     Can I get the link to the journal submission? So I can read it for myself? I would love to see the number of observations in this study... which seem to be never mentioned...  _Europe     Thanks! The infographics says ""of of"" ibuprofen  _Europe     How about turmeric or Curcumin  _Europe     I don’t understand.. it can be use?  _Europe     Que opinan los médicos mexas _mx  ?     _Europe      hey doc, if spitting was the solution, this wouldn't be a problem.  _Europe     Double negative there, please clarify this tweet as to whether Ibuprofen is generally recommended to treat COVIDー19 or not.   _Europe     Has the company who manufactures most of the core ingredient being investigated after whistleblower complaints recently?  _Europe     INCLUDE TAIWAN IN  SO WE CAN FUCKIN HELP   _Europe     i don’t know. who does it?  _Europe     This is the most confusing statement ever: “does not recommend against...” Do we avoid it or not?  _Europe         _Europe     Following  _Europe     This is better info.  _Europe     Perhaps people would be more clear on this topic without the double negative.  _Europe     WHO should recommend AGAINST use of Ibuprofen at any time infectious disease is a risk. Ibuprofen is contraindicated when heightened immune responses are needed. These NSAIDs inhibit antibody production. Do not use!!!   _Europe     What about now? Are you TRYING to raise the mortality rate of this thing????  _Europe     Paracetamol or Tylenol is useless and the 1 dangerous drug in the world.  _Europe     I don't see any information about the  use of ibuporfen on your web site  Are you going to post an update on this topic?  _Europe     Thank you a lot and if possible try to share which medicines we aren't supposed to take. Thanks  _Europe     Is this the same with Naproxen ?  _Europe     Even if Tylenol is better 😂  _Europe     Is Crona virus found in Chicken ?  _Europe     ficus religiosa 🌲  _Europe     Thank you all for your dedication to preserving civilizations. Godspeed to you all in monitoring &amp; in research for relief to advance to effective doses for all sizes of us!  _Europe     Are you kidding?  _Europe     Noted Thank you so much..&amp; i don't know why some people's from some countries always sending wrong sms &amp; using name WHO.. it's totally making wrong idea..everyone crossing with a critical situation in the world.. Don't have Minimum knowledge &amp; common sense  _Europe     This corona virus is only spreading in humans but not among the animals, so please test these animals and find what makes them prevent from this virus. Please work on it, i think it will comes with a positive solution. Thank you.  _Europe     Sir, I have read many messages all  says the homeopathic medicine called arsenic album is best for cure of COVID 19...Sir plz  tell me is it right information?  _Europe     Could you please clarify? You are cited to be telling otherwise:   _Europe     Spread the information  _Europe     WHO, please improve your grammar usage and support the obvious.  _Europe     Issa double negative 🙄  _Europe     Sir what is the recommend medicine for fever  _Europe     Research and development of new drugs!  If agreed to do clinical treatment control experiments.  COVID19 caused the immune cytotoxic war!  Necrosis of the lungs!  There are medicines to cure immediately.  The control group can choose any product!  _Europe     One thing virus in general is beyond our understanding we are still Stone Age technology primitive.  DNA and genetic are like God evolution many years before we blood fight. First step and find out first. What or which good virus can eat bad virus?   _Europe     What about ace and arbs  _Europe     🗺📲📡 mobile world. 🗺📺📡 television world.Life is an criteria even to solve this entire universe.There are mostly two types of patients we found in every house. 1)God's patients ⛪🕌🕍🕉2)Doctor's patients 💉💊📄🗺📲📡 mobile world.🗺📺📡 television world.   _Europe     Well good cause I take 1600 plus mgs a day for pain to avoid narcotics.  _Europe     I guess this is the difference between biochemical studies &amp; in-vivo ones. Diseases don't read textbooks. The ACE theory makes sense, but if not observed in practice, a pinch of salt is needed But is still advised to avoid for a large group of people including asthmatics who may have worse symptoms   _Europe      I hope your recovery and isolation are going well. Following NSAID comment on _time last night this WHO guidance, in alignment with ESC and EMA, should be the basis of guidance to patients on NSAID use in suspected COVID-19. Good luck with bouncing back.   _Europe     Ibrufen and other related groups multiply the multiplication process of COVID2019 , in Italy one of the reason for excessive deaths of COVID2019 patients is the intake of ibrufen, so must be AVOIDED  _Europe     Are vaccines for avian influenza a virus that works on virus corona?  _Europe     Curious where it’s made?  _Europe     Thank you  because stuff like this is concerning me that people will believe everything on social media   _Europe     Whoever is in your publication department needed to proofread. Does not and against in the same sentence? 🤦🏼‍♀️ clearasmud  _Europe     Evan, Thank you for checking this out.  I do appreciate!  _Europe     Dear WHO, maybe you need to be a bit more clear. Many will only see this “WHO does not recommend” and not the rest and go around giving wrong info. Thank you  _Europe     Overexpression of ACE in myeloid (immune and epithelial) cells results in Ca++ recruitment.  Could ACE also result in calcium chloride-associated fluid retention (relevant to Covid19 lung filling)?If so, could potassium supplementation (along with zinc) help balance that? Regarding COVID-19, people are reporting permanent damage to lungs and other organs if they are infected. Does this happen with every case of COVID-19, or just the ones that require more intense treatment?  _Europe     What else is China saying, Mr. Official Spekesperson?  _Europe     And Could Paracetamol worsen disease for  COVID19?  _Europe     Well then can I take a herbal extract instead of a genetic chemical formula for what's going on.  _Europe     Draw blood from the one who heals from Corona and give it to the injured   _Europe     Where did this rumor start?  _Europe     _R_Ellison     _Europe     ibuprofen lowers body temp, making the virus happypyrexia = good  _Europe     Bussin’ out them double negatives!  _Europe     That's a double negative, so WHO recommends taking ibuprofen??  _Europe     COLLODIAL SILVER,VINEGAR,CHAGA MUSHROOMS,VITAMIN C.THATS ALL YOU NEED  _Europe     Why can't you just say you do recommend Ibuprofen for treating fever for patients with COVID-19? "".. does not...against"" double negative anyone?  _Europe     I noticed this isn't on the mythbusters page yet. Will it be added?   _Europe     Bitter kola is good for lung infection but is it effective for coronavirus  _Europe     it is not chinese virus. it is CCP Bio-weapon originated in Wuhan, Chinazi.  _Europe     Ask them to turn off the tap while lathering their hands   _Europe     Please share this that everyone should knows about it  _Europe     You are giving a confusing message. In first tweet you said will recommend to not use it. NOW NOT.  _Europe     What about the newest rumors of using elderberry?  _Europe     The double-negative ('does not recommend against') is causing confusion for people.  I had to read it out loud to make sure I wan't misunderstanding it myself.  _Europe     Please invent medicine for the covid 19 virus please request you W. H. O.  _Europe     No evidence of links between Ibuprofen and infections? What about the study made by the French administration for drug safety in april 2019 ?   _Europe     I say don’t use ibuprofen! It clearly seems to be becoming an issue for people. I’m prettt sure someone already talks about ACE2 - which is basically ibuprofen just google it . I say it’s a no go especially since some people are very much so having a reaction.  _Europe     Is this still the official statement?  is saying otherwise as of an hour ago"	0

“It’s crazy how expensive insurance premiums have become and how healthcare has become tied to employment.”When we treat healthcare like a commodity to be bought and sold where third parties can make trillions, how could we expect the result to be anything other than this?Look, when I preheat the oven to 425, put the pizzas I made for dinner in that mutherfucker, and 15 minutes later they’re cooked, it doesn’t surprise anyone. It was built to do this. Why then are we so surprised in this country when the systems work the way they were designed?“We’re so tribal &amp; divided.”I mean, who could’ve predicted such a thing resulting from a strict binary setup that was built upon still unresolved issues of slavery &amp; colonial imperialism. You preheat the oven to a certain temperature, don’t be surprised when shit gets cooked.“So the only option we have is a hard reopen of the economy in the middle of a pandemic?”When you have an economy that was built to favor those with generational wealth largely on the backs of those who weren’t allowed to create it and no real social safety net... I guess so.	0

  What will happen if we don't wear masks? probably acquire herd immunity in the long run and grow stronger, but that would come at the cost of the lives of elders and immunocompromised. Look at what is happening in Sweden. Look at what happened in Italy back in March..  I dont believe the elderly are in any more danger than they are during flu season. We have been lied to  What makes you think so?Ok hypothetical question, if you believe that they are more in danger as scientific evidence was convincing enough to you. Would you willing to sacrifice ur autonomy and wear a mask? Or are you more of a believer in survival of fittest?  Survival of the fittest has nothing to do with it. We all look out for ourselves and our kin. If there was evidence that there is a deadly virus out there, killing left and right, we wouldn't need the media to tell us. If it was dangerous, I'd be doing the right thing  The virus isn't deadly in sense of killing everyone sporadically, but it targets elders and HRG. It's nothing like flu which kills 600K out of 1 billion (0.1%) in 2019 where as as it has claimed over 400K over out 8 millions confirmed cases in 4 months only.  Sorry but I've heard all these arguments debunked numerous times that I wouldn't even know where to start. If you think this virus is so dangerous then I'm sorry but you've been had. False death certificates and people dying of other causes is just the tip of the iceberg	0
So: This money to cover 80% of the salaries of retained workers who are not working due to a Coronavirus shutdown. What is “a Coronavirus shutdown” and how is it proved?Does this mean employers have to go through a redundancy process and then shout “Psych! Not really! Gonna get a government grant, but you’re taking a salary cut”? Again: what is the test for this? Really interested in the details here… This is making some sense now: you send employees on gardening leave &amp; you get a grant for a significant proportion of their wages. Then I think the VAT deferral functions as a loan to bridge the period while the gov gets the structures to pay in place…?  I was initially “yes, at fucking last some assistance”, but now I’m not so sure. It now seems like it could be a load of hurdles (wages cover), and effectively a 0% loan (VAT deferral) which isn’t nothing, but doesn’t seem super useful in the absence of a economic expansion.	0

He was working today when we went to stock up for our self-quarantine. We went to another lane.

 Your thoughts- have we successfully achieved the original goal of flattening the curve? What is our antibody rate? What does it look like as we get closer to herd immunity? What would our numbers look like if our NH cases and deaths were at the National average? 1/2 Sorry, I don’t see Part 1/2 in this thread or my replies… I’m no twitter expert.  I will try to find it. I think Minnesota has probably “flattened the curve” so far — we never hit a point where the health system as a whole was being overwhelmed, forcing people to go without treatment. (That’s not to say that couldn’t still happen down the road.) I haven’t seen any recent data estimating the share of Minnesotans who’ve been infected, so I can’t speak to antibody rates.MN’s nursing home COVID deaths are worse than our neighbors, but middle-of-the-pack nationwide — way better than the worst states. 	0

   And when you present the curve for deaths in Sweden you're using the days the deaths get reported. Not when they actually happened.The peak was in in the middle of April. So there's been a decrease for over a month Source (excel file):     And cases are going down. So far there has been no increase in cases after the peak in w15. The restrictions and guidlines started w12-14Dark purple = people in need of careLight purple = mostly health care workersSource (in Swedish):     The first restrictions and guidelines came around w12 and the directives for social distansing actually came out officially first in w14.New admissions to ICU started to decrease one week after the new cases Same source as above.    The % of people with antibodies is representative of the end of w15. Not todayAnd the sample of hospital workers included a lot of administrative workers that don't see patients. The numbers is more current though   Well. That source doesn't reflect who has been testedIn the beggining Sweden only tested people in eldery care or so sick that they needed hospital care (dark purple above)Now they are testing a lot of other people. More tests, more positive results	0

"So people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies (serology) from the total. Is this consistent with what is being observed?COVID19 9/xA ubiquitous assumption made is, that at the start, all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as SAR-CoV-2. But is this assumption always correct?COVID197/xAs a pandemic evolves, the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered. It is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease.COVID198/xMost serologic assays have ranged from 1-3% all the way up to 20-30% in areas such as New York City. And the curve seems to be ending in NYC.  What gives?COVID1910/xSimilarly, in a recent study of an isolated Alpine community in Austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected.COVID1911/xIt seems the pandemic has stopped in that community, with a high antibody prevalence of 42.4%. Notably, children were less likely to be infected.COVID1912/xIn another study, it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected, with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ACE2 receptor.COVID19 13/xAnother fascinating study of a ship expedition to the Antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected.H/T  COVID19 14/xSo it seems likely we cannot estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific SAR-COV-2 protective antibodies.COVID19 15/xHow could this be? Is it possible not all are likely to be infected? I suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical. I will share two possibilities others have explored.COVID19 16/xThe most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human/primates/mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross-immunity derived from other coronaviruses.COVID19 17/xThis is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure. Perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past! Thank you!COVID19 18/x How could we be protected? It is impossible to tell. Our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science.  Maybe polymorphisms in receptors, immunity, or other ways. We might never know. But we do know evolutionary pathways selectCOVID19 19/xAnother possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. One such study has shown that as a possibility. They found T cell reactivity from viable T cells stored before SARS-CoV-2. In nearly one-half of cases!COVID19 20/xThis study was small but very provocative. If confirmed, this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the ""S"" (as in susceptible). In other words, you can be functionally ""immune"" even if not exposedCOVID1921/xImportantly, and somewhat obvious, they will not have typical SAR-CoV-2 antibodies. But they may still have protective cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses.COVID19 22/xIt would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick. Low hanging fruit!COVID1923/x Modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets (proteome) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies.COVID19 24/xIt is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity. That would explain why there are clusters among families or friends.  And also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers.COVID1925/xGlobally we have heard from colleagues in Peru, Ecuador and Greece saying “the parking lots were full, we had no more beds.  They are gone”COVID1926/xThe problem is we have no reliable way of knowing who is susceptible, and how is not.  I do not recommend anyone reads this as a way to relax our safety measures.  But hopefully this give you hope.COVID1927/x highly recommends I read the A Camus book. Highly descriptive of the current situation.COVID1928/xIn the meantime stay safe, use masks in public, quarantine yourself if ill. And remain hopeful.COVID1929/x"	0

2 Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous!Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems. 1 COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose. 3 Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. 4 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 5 You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.and have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong south China.It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States.In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections rangingfrom the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.What is COVID-19?COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.	0
Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.OpenParlyZWThe best way to protect yourself against COVID19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. OpenParlyZWHand dryers are not effective in killing COVID19 . To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. OpenParlyZWCan an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus ?UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.OpenParlyZWThermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. OpenParlyZWHowever, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever OpenParlyZWSpraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). OpenParlyZWBe aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations OpenParlyZWDo vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus OpenParlyZWAre there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).OpenParlyZWHowever, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care OpenParlyZW	0

   Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?Che l'indicazione è stare a casa, non girare, se si può.  altre indicazioni sensate sono qua su questo sito del ministero  , pare che gli asintomatici non siano particolarmente in grado di contagiare Non è vero che gli asintomatici non siano particolarmente in grado di contagiare,  lo ha ripetuto spesso.   Ancora co'burioni?  Avete anche rotto un po'io cosiddetti. I dati e le direttive delle autorità sanitarie no e le chiacchiere di un egomaniaco in cerca di like sono oro colato?   Speriamo bene che gli asintomatici non contagino. Una cosa è certa che gli asintomatici , come tali, tossiscono o starnutiscono meno degli altri. Comunque l'obiettivo è evitare il tilt del sistema sanitario, mica come qui    Who e ecdc dicono la stessa cosa .   Sì, che anche gli asintomatici possono contagiare.	0

But, sporting events, concerts, Disney are all closed for a reason. COVID-19 is just like the flu. Realistically we will all eventually get this, just like we have all had the flu before. But this is a new virus that needs to be slowed down for our medical field to catch up.Tower thread - The fact people are going out to crowded public areas (bars for the most part) is mind boggling. Yes younger people (under 55/60) are mildly effected for the most part (unless you have a preexisting illness). But any age is still just as contagious as the next.You can have COVID-19 and not show a single symptom. Then go visit your grandparent/parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint. So many people are so uneducated on COVID-19. Yes the media has completely overblown this.The only way to allow the medical field to catch up is SOCIAL DISTANCE yourself. If you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly (e.i. China &amp; Italy) causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with COVID-19 that may or may not be ina critical condition. On top of that that, it’s the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up, then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out. It’s not a beat it, it’s a slow it down.As young people in society it’s our duty to slow this virus down. Avoid social gatherings, avoid large crowds, wash your fucking hands, wipe down machines at the gym, socially distance yourself. If you have mindset of “I’m young, and this really doesn’t effect me”, then not onlyare you being selfish but you’re the route cause for spreading. In 2 weeks, the people out in public crowds now are going to be the same people complaining when all nonessential companies (medical, emergency, food sources) are closed for 3 weeks to try and control all this.	1

     COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates. From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.Theresa Tam is Canada's Anthony Fauci [only better]. Canada's Derek Sloan would fit right into the crazy end of the Republican Party. That's all you need to know.    It is honestly embarrassing how much hate this woman receives, and I really don't understand why. (I'm guessing racism and sexism play a part.)    ..and your theory is based on said testing? Please verify.     It has been confirmed the virus cant stand heat.For the small cost of heating/savings from turning off air conditioning, life can be saved.The Chinese Dr.s that have beat this have told us vitamin C + heat kill the virus. It is relatively easy to kill as caught in early stages     The human body is at a constant temp.. even when the exterior is hotter. So, 85° F would ( possibly kill of surface virus).. but you cannot increase  body temp 30°C ..without killing them ,  maybe  you can just pop them in a oven for a while ? Lol...     Virus lives on surfaces such as tongue, nostrils, throat for a long time before it reaches  lungs. Inhaling warm air such as in a sauna or hot environment would kill or inhibit growth of virus on these surfaces. Sunshine, sauna, coughing out phlegm with the virus is recommended.     Sure. Just take the stats from Mexico. Compare them to the stats on Europe.     It would be great if you could share a link to these stats. Thanks	0

" Herd immunity no sooner than November 4th.  Correct Love your books. But love when more your passion for the truth Also, vaccines are more lucrative than good old cheap common sense herd immunity. National action requires a Pelosi Congress, who would allocate everybody's savings away and destroy the economy.This has always been the plan. It was done against Bush with not even a twitch, and they expect to do it again. In Brazil this information is coming from blood banks, which test every donation. In Rio de Janeiro the antibody rate went from 4% in April to 14% in May, and 28% in the beginning of June.In the US the Red Cross should certainly have this info. Why isn't it available?  That's a great point! Antibody tests are important if for no other reason, they still don't know how long the antibodies last and/or resist reinfection.  No one has yet to be able to answer that but I assume they are still testing to determine? Who knows?  My bro works for a biotech company who makes Covid tests and because covid mutates so slowly (unlike influenza) there should be lasting immunity. Which also means if enough people get it, it will fade away completely. Just like SARS and MERS (both coronaviruses) Because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunity's work. Harris County's mask edict has just been extended until late August. By which time this would have been over any way. But now the can say ""see! Look at what my mask edict accomplished!""  Yikes. That makes sense. But it's so sickening in it's sneakiness. What about the CDC anti body testing done in late March/early April? In the early days everyone said this can’t be a hoax because the whole world is locking down. Ok. Fair. Now flip the situation: why is only the US locking down (to this extent) again? 🤔 Red Cross,in VA at least, is testing every person donating blood for Covid19 antibodies. For a limited time. Lowest US death total for a Tuesday since March 25. I imagine Team Apocalypse will still be screaming for lockdowns when we hit zero deaths. You and others with a big audience must keep asking for this and promoting it until decision makers get it. Keep up the great work! Right after the election Same thing is happening in Houston  SMH. So why hasn't Gov Abbott been mentioning this of late, if at all? Great work Alex.  Of the recent pandemics which ones have the designed successful vaccines?AIDS/hiv, colds, sars, mers, h1n1?   They only get the flu right every once in a while. Governor Polis just shut down bars for 30 days.   is actively discouraging companies, universities etc from doimg any antibody testing. Elections.....  Agreed!Vaccine is aqcuired immunity in the herd, otherwise it's natural herd immunity. People that think vaccines are the answer, don't realize they are actually for herd immunity. They don't realize vaccines are not harmless,either. Ohio was supposed to have the results of theirs in May...For some reason we are still waiting  Airlines are (obv) businesses &amp; they have been working on a committee with the President to get back to opening up our country. Fireworks at the state level xcld bc some Govs dont want happiness &amp; prosperity or anything positive happening that would help Trump get re-elected. A friend asked his Dr. to authorixe antibody test in Utah. Dr. said not reliable enough &amp; wouldn’t. What's happening in NC?  That's my question...I live in NC. Yeah, be a REAL shame if herd immunity was achieved naturally before a vaccine can be rushed to market.  NIH has been performing one. Results will be out in the next month or Two.  112 n no a v Because reliable tests aren’t out there Alex, be careful with antibody tests. Body deals usually so easy with the Sars COV 2, that most of people don't even develop antibodies.  Is that when the often mentioned T- cells come into the picture? _Law I'm not sure what you mean but maybe I get some of it? I believe that there are no coincidences ever. So how is it that ALL THE EVENTS HAPPENING ARE RIGHT ON TIME? FOR SOMETHING. HOW CAN THE VIRUS DO WHAT IT'S DOING VERY METHODICALLY AND SPECIFICALLY AT CERTAIN TIMES AND PLACES Alex, what's happening in NC?  I live here and all I hear is gloom and doom.  Despite the numbers our own illustrious  dashboard tells us.  Great article! 👍 New York City antibody results were over 20% two months ago. I would expect that they are much higher now, but there has been silence on that issue. Assuming 20% positive on NYC antibody test, that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from NYC alone. My guess is the real antibody results in NYC are much higher, which is good news, not bad news, of course, because it leads to herd immunity. It's even more fundamental. ""Novo"" Wuhan virus found in waste water samples in Spain - in early 2019. The whole Fauci narrative was BS from Day One.  The deaths are seasonal, predictable and many are the result of malpractice  It’s irrelevant because by Fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero. They won’t be able to hide that glaring fact. I suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming, since it endangers the narrative. The CDC says for every 1 case we identified, there were at least 10 we didn’t.  Fauci claimed yesterday the US would see 100,000 cases per day. Do the math.  We have been well over his number for some time.  We are now identifying those by testing people who aren’t ill. And two months ago they said that’s what needed to happen, more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms.  Now they are saying that’s bad bad because, well that’s a lot of cases.  I feel like we are being punked. Nefarious? They want this to continue? Or incompetence?  Pharmaceutical industrial complex  has FDA EUA approved Covid- 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities! This will help identify those with antibodies! Antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around. Talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry, molecular, or microbiology field, they will tell you the same thing. ￼""New research from Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 demonstrate so-called T-cell-mediated immunity to the new coronavirus, even if they have not tested positively for antibodies."" Probably because they're saying the tests are inaccurate. 🤷‍♀️  What are you referring to in NC? Fredericksburg VA this morning my husband was talked out of antibody test by doctor because she said they’re inconclusive and pointless. my wife and I did our part to reduce the death rate by surviving COVID.  It wasn't fun but almost everyone who get it survives--including almost every person in the U.S. workforce.  have politicized COVID because restarting the economy helps Trump. Likely adding the number of “positive  antibodies” test results in with the “covid positive” results.  It’s easier to fluff the numbers that way 🤨 cause it is “all covid” ...  Herd immunity will never be achieved for corona viruses. Just like it doesn't exist for influenza viruses.It will or mutate and become part of life or mutate and disappear. My guess is the second one.   It can’t mutate and disappear, bc literally natural selection. Also Coronavirus family don’t drift antigenically with a rate remotely resembling influenza. The Red Cross is now offering free antibody testing with a blood donation. Hopefully that data will be aggregated and released. Also, I look forward to seeing this one on  in two weeks  Well you live in NY - enjoy. While good news, think we’ve a longer way to go to get to herd immunity. Alex, what’s happening in N.C. haven’t seen any stats. Their website is not much help. No actual number for hospitalization and nothing about antibodies.cc:   The NC study is not randomized. These volunteers are self selected. I haven't requested an antibody test because I don't think I have had the virus. Please stop calling it a randomized study. According to these Swedish researchers antibody tests under count infected by 2x!  NYC could easily be at 60% if they are right.   What is happening in NC? It’s funny seeing people talk about the ins and outs of things like herd immunity and nucleic acid/ anti body test that probably never heard of any of those things 3 months ago. Compare to other countries -- if we are so far behind then other countries must assuredly be ahead of us.I don't think it's that easy.   In the early stages the virus is too spotty go get a grip on it for something useful. Dude are you arguing herd immunity is achieved at 30%  NYC seroprevalence is around 25% and we see immunity playing a huge role. Not abolishing the virus as herd would, but it’s ability to spread is extremely limited in NY. Angry twitter man has found all the answers  Arithmetic has good reason to be angry with us all these days. And T-Cell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies.  New York, Italy, etc seems to show that we're nearing herd immunity, like it or not.  Not sure about doing things NY or Italian style. They basically euthanized the vulnerable by using nursing homes for CV19 patients. Mental midgets.  Hundo p I thought NIH was doing this? I volunteered but apparently was not selected.. madness, we are in the hands of luddites,  cretins &amp; CovidiotInChief I think you are gonna be right.  Or close.  But the evidence will be, I think, on Worldometer or similar.  Deaths for sure are WAY down.  Let's see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon.  I hope so. We will not see a widespread, accurate antibody test because each person who tests positive is one less customer for a vaccine shot. Um...no.I don't know if you noticed, but New York was a bit tense while all that was going on Confirmation for all the “just wait two weeks” ninnies, Karens, and NPCs. They are gonna fight hard, but keep sharing the data. Can’t hide from the truth: It could be that there are so many reliability problems with the antibody testing kits. What’s happening in NC? What did I miss? Why is  not demanding this? Another day another article. ..Now they say test for T-cells and not for antibodies. .."" For every person testing positive for antibodies, two were found to have specific T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.""Do we know what to test ? Can you try to make these results available? And that would wipe out the pretext for mail-in voting in November. Gotta make it last to November, then it will all go silent We don't know because the CDC is not treating this ""viral disease"" like a real emergency that requires excellent data and surveillance. They are treating it like a political bludgeon. Clear data would hamper their mission. So what is the end game here, who is benefitting from falsely keeping us all in panic ? The only semblance of  malice I can think of is that some public health experts have a tiny bit more amount of fame.   Antibody tests that are positive for ANTIBODIES is like having your own vaccine on board.Do more testing for antibodies, viral tests when symptomatic.COVID19 COVID19TX_o_v_e_truth    Can someone more well informed than myself please explain to me, if it's possible to have both T cells and antibodies present for the same pathogen? Or do the T cells (if present) automatically override/ cancel out the ABs? Did you see this study from Karolina ka in Sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people don’t produce antibodies but produce an effective T cell immune response?     Remember when Birx said on April 1, 2020,”there is no more flu”. After that day any flu deaths were counted as Covid. We stupidly went along and believed anything they said. Meanwhile Arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care. Resources are being rationed and people are dying that could have been saved. Might wanna do a bit more research on antibody testing You will never get that data. The last thing Democrats want is the true on this hoax to get out. They want us wearing bacterial-laden PETRI DISHES on our faces, to MAKE US SICK, so that in October, when we all have respiratory illnesses they can yell “COVID! COVID! SEE? ITS COVID! NO VOTING IN PERSON! CLOSE THE POLLS”   _Law So I heard someone on OAN NEWS said that the numbers of new cases are being cooked but my thought is what if it's worse than that what if they are using MANIPULATED TEST KITS SOMEHOW IT'S SURELY POSSIBLE EVERY OTHER THING GOING ON? This graph represents HERD IMMUNITY.  Isn’t this what we want?   Of course, they can manage to produce tests that over report positives by 50% but not antibody testing.  It's like the media wants to propagate the scam, as if they have a motive to harm the leader of the country's popularity or something. The CDC has shown itself to be another incompetent, self perpetuating Government bureaucracy.  Random Covid19 testing should have started in January 2020.   Without random testing you have no idea of what’s happening.   The CDC is clueless. So let’s just let it spread and we will find out.  Hey! Dr.  you retweeting crazy conspiracy theories is really going to help out  win those center moderate voters!  Keep up the great work 👍 I’ve been asking this the whole. It’s odd Herd immunity would upset the plans; mail in ballots, fear for control, vaccines for all, contact tracing which really is the ground work for ""social score""; most of all Marxist take over. They don't want this to end....anything to prolong the assault on liberties and freedom.....and anything to get rid of Trump. What is happening in NC?  A little background of truth.  NC is JUST NOW starting to test Nursing Home residents and workers in the facilities.  JUST now.  50% of NC deaths are from Nursing homes. Looking at the real stats. _donga Blame the idiot in chiefTrumpKillsUS If you are uncovering asymptomatic infections in a major way, we are closer to the end of the pandemic than most people realize. Isn’t it the darkest before dawn?  I hope you are right. I want this over. I can’t take it anymore. We are being scammed. The testing and metrics for case positive numbers are shit. Positive because u maybe talked to someone with covid?????  This whole situation is completely fucked with a bunch of morons pointing to data that is worthless out of the gate. Junk in junk out.  Open the country NOW Posting this again. This seems to be correct. And this: They are all going to deny herd immunity until November 4. Their followers are not exactly difficult to manipulate. NJ governor just “paused” indoor dining although COVID burned out here months ago. explain the ""what is happening in NC is happening everywhere""?  Earlier tonight there was a report that North Carolina antibody testing showed 17% exposure implying a very low IFR which would mean the virus has fewer to infect and is not as lethal to those it does.  Why did they scream in March we need more tests. Now we are doing it and now they are like shut it down. The left gives me a headache.   REALLY?? Come on  why are you giving us this information?"	0

"Hey , why won't you tweet a statement saying that you did not pay or compensate Darren Wilson for the interview? Why silent? Ferguson Because  &amp;  Stephanopoulos made a murderer even richer &amp;should hang their heads in shameboycotting ABC &amp; advertisers of the show   I have asked a competitor for the interview for a ballpark figure.   they probably had to pay him to even get him to come out of wherever he's been hiding  It appears  is acting as ""old media"" and that they only speak to ""real journalists.""    This is rather clever, watch the wording of denial, push up the amount then deny it as ludicrous.    They are not confirming.   'Cause they paid a murderer, that's why.😡  A craftsman is worth his fare. ABC wanted to interview. Wilson is entitled to be paid Ferguson  - Because we know the answer.  because they out bud Fox News  here go the evidence  Yessir bro...you're on it!  &amp;  paid that cold-blooded murderer half-a-mill for ratings as a promo for his ""tour""!   boycott boycott. Remember ABC is owned by Disney.No more magic kingdom. Disney pays Haitian workers13 cents hr   As they say, ""Something smells rotten in Denmark"".  they choose silence cause they know the outcome of both admitting and getting caught lying. Thus they are guilty.   we are hearing up to $400k , no denial yet.: Cn't believe  paid him bc wdn't that amt of $$ allow George S 2 take off the kid gloves. Sounded like DarrenWilson wrote the Qs  with knowledge of the DarrenWilson interview talks said that ABCoffered to pay “mid-to-high”six figures for the interview  I just assumed he was. Most get paid for an exclusive, right?  proceeds of crime need to be redistributed to family of Mike Brown   Darren Wilson is getting a BIG pay check for this. Darren Wilson is cashing in on ABC &amp; shooting FergusonDecision    Brothers &amp; Sisters lets Unite Did they?  i understood that none of the networks that discussed an interview with him were paying him??  Is it confirmed he got $$?   - Cause they paid $500K (oh, and $500K in 'donations)._Writer     Can Alleged ""Criminal Profit From Known Proceeds Attributed To His Very Acts Under Probe!""  how much are mikeys parents selling shirts for? oh wait.. didnt the mother assault the Grandmother for trying to sell shirts?  because they paid him  Tell the truth ABC  Wasnt he paid 1/2 Mil?

The neighbors last name Ståhfrääs means A hard on...  Guys, it was a honey trap! he just wanted an easy buzz Why have I not heard of this, and I'm in Sweden, and not even that far from Ystad!?!? hard to beat. there are those who get turned on by having their own limbs amputated, luckily its a short lived obsession  I would guess the hornets were just reacting to being poked.

It seems to as a fake article. As this ”Neighbour Bertil Ståhfrääs” sounds weird. Translated to eng Bertil Boner.  Maybe he was just trying to get a buzz…  but why did his neighbour weigh his scrotum?  The neighbour's name is a sexual pun in Swedish. It's a joke.  its not real news... It was from a Swedish satire site... I doubt that this is true considering the fact that the neighbours name is hard on in swedish :)  Considering his neighbour's surname translates to ""erection"", I'd agree that it's a hoax. The neighbour's name Ståhfrääs actually means hard-on, but spelled as if it was a peer's name.   actually it's not real, gotta understand Swedish to get it ;)  Hmm, according to this, it isn't true?  but I don't know what their sources are. Do you think it could be murder?  The mind boggles..  I feel sick... how stupid can anyone be!!!  so bizarre!!! Some people's kids, I tell ya.  Buzzing...

This is not only horrible, but kind of stupid to boot.   Brilliant!  That's blatantly a hoax! The neighbour's last name is Swedish slang for hard-on.  the hornet's nest was clearly begging for it.  story was a hoax what a way to go  It was a freak accident, like those chaps with vacuum cleaners... I was just walking along in my dressing gown...  Albeit sad.  It was a hoax, Stephen ! ""Bertil Ståhfrääs"" &amp; ""Siv Underlivh"" are Swedish for ""erection"" and ""fetish.""

"      It’s used in emergency situations, and in combination with other drugs. The FDA commissioner and CDC have both said it’s still in trials, but may work. My point is that saying COVID-19 is just like the flu and we have drugs already is reckless at best.      “The FDA approved a drug that has no clinical trials nor proof of working for COVID-19 so we’re all good” is a terrible argument.      Opium isn’t a new drug either. Just because a drug has been used for one thing doesn’t mean it will work on another - and there is currently zero proof chloraquine will kill off COVID-19. So assuming everything will be fine because of said drug is dangerous.      It is an anti-viral drug with zero proof that it works on COVID-19 at this time.      The South Korean groups warned that there is ""currently no standard treatment for COVID-19.”“patients showing severe pneumonia-like symptoms, high-risk groups including the elderly and the chronically ill, are target groups for a more ""active"" administration of the drugs.”      The treatments for a flu are tested for months or years - chloroquine has JUST STARTED FDA clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19. I hope a treatment is found, no matter where it comes from. I just don’t like the hyping of a drug as the cure when it hasn’t been fully tested."	1

*Can I catch COVID-19 from feces, animals, pets, surfaces or packages?*🚽 *Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?*The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. 🐾 *Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?*Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times.Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.🐶 *Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?*There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.	0
"I'll add that I keep hearing this ""herd immunity"" deal. It isn't a thing yet, folks. But what IS a thing is long-term lung damage after contracting COVID. Why chance it? As someone who suffers from asthma, I can tell you that constricted breathing for a lifetime is WHACK!   Word! There are 4 other coronaviruses that give people colds. Immunity from those viruses only last 3-12 months. So herd immunity may not ever be a thing with COVID-19. Exactly. We don't know enough about COVID-19 to even discuss herd immunity, but most folks who refuse to accept this don't understand science so much. That hasn't stopped them from spreading disinformation that could prove deadly."	0

Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease-  The new coronavirus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates-  Some viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more when the weather is colder. But it is still possible to become sick with these viruses during warmer months. At this time, we do not know whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather warms up.-  For the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, we have reason to expect that like other betacoronaviruses, it may transmit somewhat more efficiently in winter than summer, though we don’t know the mechanism(s) responsible.- ,  It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.-  	0

Myth buster: Per the World Health Organization, 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19.  OCCOVID19  Yes it’s true, also emits a homosexualizing ray!!!  3 months ago I moved right next to a 5G antenna and since then I‘ve been attracted to the opposite sex and haven’t stopped coughing... Even the military uses 5G as a weapon, and your allowing Verizon and others to so easily instal it in our cities?  5g breaks down your immune system, thus making you more succepable to sickness. The coronavirus is a common cold, but bombard the body with 5g, killing off it's immune response, and covid19 can be deadly. Seniors are most at risk. OC needs to shut off 5G!  Look up ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Thanks.  The fact that you even had to tweet this is depressing. History is going to look back on us and see this tweet and say, “they were a bunch of dolts”. I can’t believe this needs to be said.	0

It is logic . Since the iPhone is the thinnest one ( lowest force).  Time to get paid.   In other words, Apple are an 'easy target' for social media users since most are Samsung lovers.. that was painful to watch.

Nobody knows if you can get COVID more than once. Nobody knows if herd immunity works or doesn’t. Nobody knows if they’ve had it and were asymptomatic. AIDS doesn’t have a vaccine. The flu vaccine doesn’t work. What is our plan here?  There's not enough data for COVID-19 to make a reliable judgement on immunity, but this may provide a clue.  Our plan is wearing masks! How difficult are we making this? Look at the numbers for all East/South-East Asian countries. I live in Thailand. People make so much fun of Americans refusing to wear masks. Even before covid masks were not uncommon here.	0

Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.HOW DOES COVID-19 SPREAD?🤧 People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 💦 The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.🥄 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. 👈 Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. ↔️ People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 whocoughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHOWhatsapp	0

Im sorry but dish towels and bandanas dont stop viruses!!! _Vetnar       Not sure about dish towels, but there’s plenty of new data showing how face coverings are very effective at SLOWING the spread. Nothing will stop this virus, but if we can slow it down, that’s what we should do!  _Vetnar       Then let’s open everything up Mike. If these masks work, why not open up 100%. You always say we gotta be just as aggressive in opening up as we were in shutting down. I’ll wear the mask but let’s open up AZ!  _Vetnar       We would love for everything to be open, so we can all go to a Cardinals game or go out to lunch! But again, masks won’t STOP the virus, just SLOW it. People still need to be vigilant and wear masks and social distance from others.   _Vetnar       There may not be any herd immunity. Folks who have had it and recovered are getting it again. There may never be a vaccine if folks are susceptible to it more than once	0

    I’m nuts? The “what” is Covid-19. It has killed almost 60,000 people in the USA in two months. It would have killed many thousands more without social distancing.Update from Mayor  on COVID-19:-7 new cases Monday, adjusted total of 473 known, confirmed COVID-19 cases-Riverside facility now able to test residents, frontline workers both with and without symptoms-Regional approach to re-opening parks with 6 municipalities   Very nice to expand access to testing in this way.  Building on success with flattening curve in city.   The curve is flat. We have a single digit daily case count for over a week in a city of 50k people. If that isn't flat please tell me what is?   There were 84 cases last week with the revisions from backlog (week ending 4/25) — average of 12/day.  Great progress, but more cases than the last week of March.  It’s a good idea to keep slowing it down before loosening restrictions.     Maybe so maybe no.  We have 473 cases in HBKN, with 19 deaths so a .04% mortality rate.  25% of NYC has antibodies according to Cuomo, so around 2.1M people had it.  The mortality rate with 17K deaths is what, .008%?  They kept their parks open.  Who did it better?     If I were mayor, I’d be opening parks. Doubt  that parks play any role in transmissions.  But I don’t have all facts, data, and expert advice.  I also think that it is one of the least important sacrifices of this very unpleasant period.	0
 _Pedro Because they are giving detailed and helpful information at this level. Using some UK wide stats and some England only stats - &amp; a few London focussed stats on transport.

Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

      You're right that it's not an argument. You haven't shown at all how private entities regulated by other private entities would ensure testing accuracy and reliability so that they can be used to deal with a pandemic. You've deflected an awful lot, though.      I reject your burden of proof. If I put in the work you will only move the goalposts and use false equivalencies. I do not think you are having this conversation in good faith. You have not even been able to answer a very specific use case for your alt hypothesis. Take care.      1/2 Yes, the specific use case of COVID19 tests that are sensitive and reliable, which are both preconditions to being medically useful. The current FDA processes for proving test function are adequate.      2/2 While the bureaucracy itself could have moved faster in this specific crisis, that failure does not invalidate the utility and need for functional standards &amp; enforcement. You are arguing against this, therefore burden of proof lies with you. Has not been met at all.      You should actually read that FDA release. It isn't doing what you seem to think it is. Burdens of proof within EUAs still required, CLIA still required. Devolving central regulatory authority to state-level regulatory authority is also included. Regulations not suspended.	0

 What is your take on the pre-existing cross-immunity idea and how it affects the herd immunity number?  Some estimates suggest that 50% or more of the population may not be susceptible at all to Covid.  Herd immunity may therefore kick in much sooner in the US. Agreed we are probably some ways off.  But then again, no one knows how much cross-immunity different populations may have.  Is it 30%, 50%, 80%?  Brazil seems to be doing the least to suppress it, so that may be one place to watch.	0
 _katie   Again, what percentage do we need to be infected to reach herd immunity and what is the mortality rate according to you?Unfortunately high Covid ’s are now baked in for next 2-3 weeks because they reflect infections 7 to 21 days earlier.Focus now must be getting numbers to plateau &amp; start falling by mid-July &amp; preventing young &amp; healthy people from infecting those older &amp;/or at higher risk Need to shut Florida down... looks like he is in a race to catch New York. _katie   That’s completely incorrect.

The World Health Organization also tackled misinformation regarding COVID-19. Here are some of them: 1. Cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coromavirus. 2. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease. This website also provides a detailed map of the cases of COVID-19 around the world: Here's a visual aid for the symptoms of COVID-19 and how to know its difference from flu and cold: It won't hurt if you think of these ahead: The worst case scenario is that your city is quarantined. Plan ahead amongst your family how you will take care of ill members. If you become infected, who will take care of your kids while you recover? Do you have enough medicine?3. The new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or amy country reporting COVID-19 cases. 4. The new coronavorus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites. 5. Handryers are not effecting in killing the new coronavirus. 6. UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. 7. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. 8. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. 9. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. 10. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. 11. There is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. 12. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. 13. To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus. However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Also from experts: The virus will not develop resistance to hand sanitizers.Next time you think cancelling events is an overreaction, over a hundred years ago, a World War I parade gave 4,500 of onlookers the flu: This shows why social distancing works: Here's a guide for preparing your home once Covid-19 cases are confirmed in your area: Here's how to care for loved ones: 1. Have these details ready asap and while everyone at home is still healthy:  A. Birthday  B. Weight and height  C. Medical history  D. Prescriptions  E. Their normal vital signs including  F. Copy of IDs and insurance docsYou will need those details in case medical practitioners come/call when the illness begins. 2. Once it does, take a note of the ff.: A. Dates, symptoms, vital signs every 6 hours  B. Hours the doctor called and their advice  C. The interventions you/the doctor made and time3. Always wash your hands before and after contact of the patient 4. Keep windows open 5. Tell the patient to spend time outside under sunshine, but without making physical contact with others 6. Change beddings every 24 hours 7. Take showers and change clothes twice a day8. Drink water regularly. The color of the urine should be light. Dark means dehydration. 9. Take multivitamins every day 10. Caffeine will help open up airways Those tips are from a nurse in the US. Will add more tips tomorrow.

Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.covid-19 myths vs truth 5G DOESN’T spread COVID-19Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks.Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms.Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm.Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerousFrequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system- which helps fight against the virus.COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climatesFrom the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentialsTaking a hot bath does not prevent the virusTaking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your body temperature is 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn youThe new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.

Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? No. There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized.Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.Should I wear a mask to protect myself? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.The mask can only be used once.If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.Is there anything I should not do? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:1. Smoking2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 3. Wearing multiple masks 4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.CoronaAlert coronavirus CoronaOutbreakThread	0

  No, it's really not safe at all right now. The numbers of cases we are now seeing are from Memorial Day weekend we suspect. The numbers that will come from the protesting will be so significant that we will be in lockdown by July 4th for an undetermined amount of time.   The same numbers that are down 30% from the week prior to Memorial Day?  Those numbers?    Not to mention who cares if there's 1,000 cases if zero of them require hospitalization.  That just helps the herd immunity cause.    They're doing it, I've seen adverts for it at urgent care places.  Question is...20 per day?  50?  Couple hundred?	0

   Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”   Similar info on Health Canada website   People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.   This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.   Quoting WHO... Sorry to flood your mentions lol. Stay safe everyone!	0
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT CORONA VIRUS ACCORDING TO WHOTaking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus diseaseTaking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of yourbath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infectionthat could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.Abba Kyari Buhari Abuja and Lagos COVID-19 Covidout Lai Mohammed	0

"But no surprise.  “ “ The first General killed in a combat zone ...   as a matter of fact he did. he was probably on vacation totally agree with you would be the correct and patriotic thing to do.   love too see a veteran in Wyoming call Donald Trump a ""fucking mutant""  Agree! He doesn't care! He has no class whatsoever! 100% So have you now joined Westborough Baptist Church in turning funerals into political circuses?????? absolutely disgusting,this man is an embarrassment for the office and USA This is sickening, please stop. were you there ???

I AGREE The purging of cmbt tested Com Staff almost complete, ""Yes men"" in place, Hussein is very close to declaring mart law. he is on vacation on the Vineyard! No time for work. complain when he does something, and complain when he doesn't.Typical conservative mentality. I'm surprised you haven't commented on shooting in Ferguson. damn!!! Racist...obeezy is never good enough for you...punk!!! too bad he can not interfere 4 marine in Mexico but he can on Brown's issue  ...You're 100 % RIGHT...Obama has NO RESPECT for ANYTHING that pertains to American VALUES, especially MILITARY The real travesty being former President Bush putting MG Greene in a position to be killed.  Don't think I heard him even utter a word of sorrow or condolences, too busy w/ Ferguson &amp; MarthasVineyard does it really shock u. it probably would've interfered on his back 9..... Shows how much class he has Ferguson is more important now....  it's his little way of showing contempt for the people who keep him in power. he was golfing Amen! worst president in the history of America . And that's coming from a  W Bush HATER  GOLF CAME FIRST FOR PRESIDENT VACATION.tcot VAscandal Ferguson DrunkDriver  It is . Especially since you sent him in there.  Did you go, Donald?  If not why? Did any member of Congress go while on vacation for 6wks?  If not, STFU! get a life donald..i only wish i could steal as good as you so i could be a billionaire he can be everywhere and nowhere  his death is sad but is his life worth more than the other soldiers lost during a war that shouldn't be? He was too busy going to a late night talk show , golf, basketball game. He was a general, not a jihad that was the reason why he did not attend the funeral! why do you hate on Obama all the time The President doesn't go to soldiers funerals because you shouldn't give more weight to one soldiers death over another. Donald you're wrong. It would be a travesty had he attended NoRespect What do you expect from him Donald? He is busy playing cover-up for al-Assad indirect support and regional failure YSE YGYT _Wallace It's the the 1st time I ever agreed with something trump had to say. I do not think a President in the past was able to attend every memorial service. Have we forgetten the one he DID attend. We as Americans that Stand Loyal with Our Troops can't expect nothing less from a ""Narcissist."" Obama is a very Sick Man! Every word that you speak further confirms you as a petty, narrow-minded, partisan moron. 😏 have you attended the funeral of every employee thats died while working for you? atravesty why? It won't bring him back or make it any easier? It doesn't help me any ? you are a fucking troll lmao   Have you just woke up from your snoring sleep to recognize Barack Obama as President of USA and C-in-C. Shame He could've at least mention him in one of his many rants True to that sir!  Add it to the mountain of travesties he and his gang have committed. Nothing new here  he's the Golfer-in-Chief not the Commander, just ask anyone in the military shut up trump! did you go? You think you're the President.  No one wanted that SOB in attendance, only real Americans were welcome RT - Palestinian children aspire to death as Martyrs: ""Everyone yearns for suicide-killing""  Nor did VP Biden or Sec. of Defense Hagel.

Palin didn't.  Paul Ryan didn't.  Cheney didn't.  Obama is a travesty No surprise in oh so many ways. By the way , Looters aren't thieves they're criminals guilty of serious felonies. travesty? you are such a fucking moron if you felt so strongly about it, why did you attend? What a fucking drama queen.  You and Lindsey Grahm must have a case of the tight ass vapors.  squirrel  He didn't know about it.   He didn't see it on the news. The President is more concerned with his golf game and vacation. Very sad. Sends a bad message to the military. choices  The Prez has serious issues with his golf swing, I mean, have you seen it? It looks like a caveman killing lunch was Bush there? Rumsfeld? Cheney? What about the oil CEO's who's interests we are there for in the first place? why is this different than any other soldier kiled in combat? Did you go?  The man is busy running the world so shut your pie hole. the real travesty is obama. He did the family a favor by keeping his worthless face out of view. A travesty of what? Besides, if he HAD attended, people would just complain that he was ignoring his other duties right? Fuck Obama! Every man has his faults. He was smart In The sense of getting votes from Mexicans by opening the border. pretty sure he's more occupied     _johnny  One word Miles, Google Sure was. This thug shows no respect to military. BECAUSE HE WAS PLAYING GOLF ON MY CORSE is it necessary? no excuse, not even if he was playing a Trump course!  He should be removed from office immediately!  oh grow up you don't lead by good example ... there is nothing honorable in constantly finding fault w POTUS  Hey Don, I'll give you a chico stick and tub of I can't believe it's not butter for your toupee. Hit me up dog! Did you really think he would give up a vacation day? Obama is just titled Commander and Chief as well as POTUS, neither makes it so. What a Disgraceto our country.BAMA b bizzzzy!        - Nelson, it's a travesty people are out to find fault. Irrelevant to the post. Don's a genius. He overcomes &amp; triumphs! ;-) I Agree with you Sir! - his actions prove how little regard he really has for our military and veterans. did you attend?? cheap politics was Cheney there? W?  When he does go to funerals or memorials, he plays footsie with female heads of state and takes selfies. It just wasn't a good time.  Vacation plans were already made."	1

They also recognise that the huge improvements in contact tracing represent the justification for asking the public to surrender some of their rights.“Successful and appropriate use of the App relies on it com- manding well-founded public trust and confidence.”The former head of no less a famously privacy-loving body than MI5 has also stressed that success or failure of a contact tracing app relies on the State being absolutely transparent and communicative with citizens to *earn their trust*. You will be used to seeing me complain that the state is doing data protection infringing thingsBut to be clear- I think a well designed and implemented app is necessecary and proportionate to our current circumstancesMy fear is that the Gov are risking that aim with secrecyAnd so, I find myself in the strange position of asserting that if the State has nothing to hide re it’s Corona Tracking App, it should have nothing to fear from letting everyone know all about it. As you say, currently we don’t need an app to track people we meet because for most of us they’re just the people we live with.The app is part of a toolkit to allow society to carefully try to restore some normality, even in the absence of a vaccine. _Ed If we are heading bk to the classroom our children and ourselves will have hundreds of contacts in a day . _Ed 1/ You don't get it, do you. The app is for when we do start going out and about even more than we are now (lockdown in Ireland has been half-arsed at best; imagine if the govt. had tried to implement protocols similar to Spain's).	0

_Javid_Lab  _ie   _NP2013   What is seasonality if not transient herd immunity? It seems to me we don’t really understand seasonality- but we guess it’s to do with temperature, sunlight or being outdoors. Do we basically have a herd immunity threshold of 20% antibodies in Summer, and 60% antibods in winter? _Javid_Lab _ie   _NP2013   Rupert when did you become convinced there would be a substantial seasonal effect? Was it when lockdown releases failed to cause rebounds (as envisaged in Paper 9)? If so what else do you infer from the non-rebounds? _Javid_Lab _ie   _NP2013   Convinced? Not convinced, I just think it’s likely. _Javid_Lab _ie   _NP2013   But why do you think it is likely? Did you always think is would be seasonal or is this a new view based on the observation that the disease - according to the data - seems to be taking a break? If it’s taking a break why can’t we book summer holidays?  _ie   _NP2013   Even back in Feb I though it was likely to be seasonal, but I also felt unless we suppress aggressively, it won't make a difference: halving R to 1.5 is irrelevant if have 1M point prevalence. BUT seasonality and low R from lockdown synergise.  _ie   _NP2013   no, seasonality is about lowering average R due to factors that will include behaviour (less cramming together indoors), susceptibility (cold nose), viable virus longevity in environment etc.  not about antibodies (for common cold, v. short-lived immunity may also play part)._Javid_Lab  _ie   _NP2013   The way I think about it, individual immunity isn’t the only factor in determining the herd immunity threshold - susceptibility (including behaviour) is equally important or more so. If ppl have bad snot or cold noses what’s the difference? _Javid_Lab _ie   _NP2013   Behaviour... hard to model. Maybe?	0

Also Im not taking no Vaccines made by China lmao  _A_Baker xD That's not the real definition during the spanish flu heard immunity was letting people get infected in hopes that the uninfected people would be protected by the infected anti bodies 🙃 And I didnt say I wouldnt take a vaccine for covid, just not Chinas lmao	0

    Houston death rate is 550 people out of 6M.  What is NYC?  Houston had not built up any herd immunity like NYC.  The protests were like a grenade into the phased process.  Houston ICU's were at 64% for non-Covid due to the shut downs.  Now delayed again.  High cost for protests.So the rise in Covid cases is because we’ve opened up and not the massive protests? Ok....I see the new talking point. Ugh. Can we get someone..anyone...to report news and stop with the talking points?   “More positive cases” doesn’t mean anything at this point. Testing has increased exponentially, and there are duplicate cases reported where people are tested more than once.

There’s a self sorting going on, and no government can stop it...Those who wish to remain quarantined are, those choosing normal life over the risks are...It’s immoral and destructive to keep things locked down when there is no fear of a health care system... _jaycee As long as you return to your beaches in your state and stay out of my state will be good with the beaches.Look at the I-10 corridor from Texas to Florida and you can see where the spring breakers and vacationers came through in February that whole corridor is contaminated.  _jaycee Contaminated. But with what?  A cold?  A flu?  Some new thing that 99.5 percent of humans can and do fight off with white blood cells alone, not even needing otc meds.   Get real.   Let's get back to work and life.  _jaycee That whole I-10 corridor is contaminated with covid-19. I didn't just pick that out of the air to say it there's a map showing where all the cases are.. I don't care if people go back to work I just don't want the people where I live to get sick because ppl come here.  _jaycee Contaminated with what?Again, what is covid-19?I'm sure you had to dig deep to think of what to say while trying to be a smart-ass. I don't know whether you realize this or not I didn't ask for any comments,I made a statement and nothing of it concerns you.  _jaycee That whole I-10 corridor is contaminated with covid-19. I didn't just pick that out of the air to say it there's a map showing where all the cases are.. I don't care if people go back to work I just don't want the people where I live to get sick because ppl come here.  _jaycee Just wanting you stop being scared.  We know it's nothing to be afraid of unless you choose to be.  Recent antibody tests show that it has a very low fatality rate and has likely been here since late 2019. You may choose fear if you wish.   _jaycee I'm  not afraid for myself. It's  the ppl in my community  I want kept safe. When vacationers come here and they've got 20 in a room and the restaurants same then a service station movies.  Who you think's going to get sick the people that live here. I care for my community.  _jaycee Also, personal digs and insults are not the way to counter paths of logic and data.  It proves many things about you, but not your point.  _jaycee I wasn't personal digs, when I repeated what you said I was making sure I had it right what you were saying repeating me because when you repeated me it sounded like you were trying to talk down to me..	0
Q. How long does the virus survive on surfaces?A. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days... (A thread👇)This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.For more information, please contact us. ✨E-mail: info.combgghealthcare health healthy healthylifestyle healthcare coronavirus Coronaturkey COVID19	0

 Just a quick question Mark, when does it end? Not with a vaccine because most people won't get the vaccine. I am one who understands that like most viruses it is herd immunity that is truly the end game. What is your opinion?I'm kinda glad they are making this decision. Let the market decide that this is a terrible idea.  Quick answer. I'm going to wear a mask in public and will avoid establishments that don't require it. The point I'm making is an economics/demand point. I'm not a doctor and don't claim to be one.	0

COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climatesFrom the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.	0

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”LetsFightCorona Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.LetsFightCorona These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.

  I guess the counter question is why do we need it? Not one soap mentioning corona virus 🤔They usually incorporate world events x It's too hard to with the situation changing several times  daily. The insert they film could be out of date by the time it goes out. They probably have other things to worry about like keeping the shows running and the staff and procedures safe and don't need the extra work  Genuine question, not being a cow, how hard would it be to film two characters already doing a scene in the pub to slip on/off a jacket and complain about empty shelves in the Kabin/Minute Mart/ Price Slice?  Soaps based on real life and the corona virus is part of lives now.. They don't have to have stats, maybe humour like singing happy birthday while washing hands before serving customers at the cafe 😁.. Just reinforce what government has said 👀  For many it's not really funny though is it? So I don't think EE taking the mick with hand sanitiser would cheer them up   Exactly. I'm already staying/working from home due to the Coronavirus. One person in the town where I teach has contracted the virus. Now schools are shut down. I don't want to watch my favorite soaps talking about it.	0

"Vatican official says there is ""a sense of regret"" that Pope Francis met with Kim Davis:   For a pope to single out one persons gain in financial &amp; fictitious belief is a malicious act &amp; without merit. only after the fuss. Why would they think meeting her was a good idea in the first place. the Humanum &amp; the upcoming OctoberSynod will provide more clarity, remember the Left Liberal FLIP agenda is at hand, we R @ APEX This Women is a Reborn again Wacker... IT'S Not her place to challenge Law or her Beliefs... you let them use you shame on you you are a man of God and The infallible are fallible? Good to know America feels the same way.It's pretty chickenshit of the Pope but he can excommunicate the Mafia but he tiptoes around Sodomites. Pretty pathetic POS  oh dear .. This is all so disappointing.. Back to the old ways it seems .. meeting her could have been balanced by his views if it were not kept as a secret,  Secrecy was the mistake. Pope needs to stop being so lovable to everyone and get on w/ real Pope-ing work: Lead Role in Inspirational Deity Delusion Opera. let's remember the type of people Jesus hung out with. Society didn't think much of them either. No regrets required  Major misstep by the Pope and Vatican. She is promoting defiance and the Pope agreed? I thought gay marriage was sort of against catholic beliefs. So should the Vatican be unbiased? lol more manipulated shite - uttered from that disgusting cult. Religious people problems. MEH    The Pope and the Vatican regret ever meeting you. tcotRT : Vatican official says there is ""a sense of regret"" that Pope Francis met ...    The pope has 100% right to choose his own sexuality. Like everyone else on the planet. Wish he'd accept that. Nothing, and I mean Nothing or No one can do mystery and intrigue like the Church. as there should be, she is bad news for christians everywhere Odd the pope doesn't support religious people. If he doesn't admit it then those who are after his neck get away scot-free. Does the Pope consider gay marriage illegal? ??Tell me please.  lmfao I read somewhere earlier this week with “statements” of “blessings” for her actions Infallible? I think not. : it's ok to pray with muslims but not ok to meet Christians,  that's the Pope for you Well Duh true colors were shown . The Pope needs to stick to popeing The  should regret meeting Davis. I don't regret leaving the church though.  I would hope so....that was one dumb move...his advisors should have known better.  Big set back.  I would check sources on this one who told him to do that, I think he may not have consulted in prayer about this, but probably got a big Republican donation.  Meh. Who gives an at's rass what an ""official"" says --let alone Bergoglio? Birds of a feather frock together.  Sorry it became known. ok Why? there should be a BIG sense of regret.  He needs to know what he stands for, not just take the advice of his staff. I'll bet there is. That idiot woman deserves no credence. if but an1 wuld stnd agst gay law it shld b d church of christ.if d vatica fail 2 se it sf as d church of christ wat den christiaty How can you have a sense of regret over meeting a human being?

The virus has been spreading in China, supplies in the affected areas have been seriously lacking, and doctors are overworked.Could WHO deploy the necessary medical supplies to contain the spread of the contagious disease in China?     What is the WHO doing to curb the spread of the virus     Care is better than cure.      Clean mind clean heart clean body😊😊😊     Avoid pubs, but PUBquarantine     Place an OZONE MACHINE in  a central location in your home. Spray nose and throat with MESOSILVER going out and coming in. Mesosilver taken internally can cure the virus in a few days. I had SARS and was dying for three months. Mesosilver cured me in 10 days. DO IT!     WHO is a joke, it's a pandemic now Ffs     Don't eat meat     Is it not simpler just to go vegan.     WHO and China are BOTH criminally responsible for this mess.  Dr Ted needs to resign.

_purple How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days.So many patients need to be tested.Our  lost 3 Critical weeks to do what physicians know needs to be done.Covid19usa COVIDー19 _purple _ZeekApp  94% of such cases are evident by 10-14 days, that's why. I agree with that _ZeekApp  Incorrect..the only country that has provided facts and effective quarantine policies and treatment is S. Korea ..and they have documented cases of 28 days_purple _ZeekApp  Symptoms of COVID-19 appear within two to 14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, runny nose and difficulty breathing.  We are looking for symptoms onset. It is understandable, we look at probability to the 99.99%tile Incorrect...but I will be patient and we will re-examine this tweet and CDC’s information We’ve seen the cases of people being exposed and didn’t present with s/s up to 28 days_purple As we collect more data, this will be updated. No one knows the final answer, but consensus is 1-14 day! Key word being “estimates” Also saying 94% of cases the incubation period is up to 14 days ..that leaves 6% of the cases are longer than 14 days &lt;••that’s a huge impact of spreading nCov19 Like I said we will most definitely reevaluate this information in the future	0

Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?- Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets.- Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.- Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.COVIDー19 COVIDStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.COVIDー19 COVID COVID19france COVID19france Covid_19	0
 Historically it has been to do serology or blood tests for pathogen-specific antibodies. This study suggests that this may not be as useful over time.  Which brings up other than live virus re-exposure tests, if there is protection, what is the best test? again, time will tell. 2/n we know that immune protection exists in animal and monkey testing upon re-exposure. However, many have used antibody titers as a test to check immune memory in the clinic. This may unfortunately not be as useful for Covid-19. Booster vaccine shots can be given if needed. However, we don’t know how those who’ve been infected already, but then have reduced antibody levels, will respond to re-exposure. The same or different?  For those who haven’t had it yet, no one wants to run that risk.	0

How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. 	0

Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine to prevent or treat. Does the coronavirus affect only older people?People of all ages can be infected. Can eating garlic help prevent infection?Garlic is a healthy food however, there is no evidence that eating garlic has protected people from corona. Can mosquito bites transmit the virus?The Coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites. Can the virus be transmitted in hot weather?Yes, it can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates Cold weather and now kill the coronavirus? No, cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the virus. 	0
Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear tobe more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treatsymptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. 	0

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.What is a coronavirus?Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold tomore severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. TThese droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in dropletsfrom a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.	0
How long does the virus survive on surfaces? Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source? Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported? Is there anything I should not do?  Differs based on surface type but about 9 days max on any surface 	0
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?(source World Health Organization)It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information.How long does the virus survive on surfaces?(source World Health Organization) on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.

 Bill, what is your opinion on recent concern that the serology tests we are using are not sensitive enough? Some at  suggested the tests were validated with controls from patients in hospital. Symptomatic and truly mild cases may not develop dectable antibodies(Yet) more evidence for a crude IFR between 0.5 and 1%   I’m not suggesting it is lower than the .5-1 % range but maybe we are closer to .5% than 1	0
Q. Should I wear a mask to protect myself?A. Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing. If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection. Also, dispose the mask properly after use. CoronavirusReachesDelhiQ.

10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.CORONA VIRUS.Thread.1. What is Corona Virus.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases....9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.12. What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?Protection measures for everyone!Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.13.(A)However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:13.(B)Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.13. (C)Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.	0

With so many contradicting ""facts"" flowing around, best to accept the safest version, especially if these ""facts"" are not substantiated by trustworthy sources. If 5G is faster and it spreads this virus does this mean 4G and the rest was then slowly making us sick? Dont they all have to some extend emit radiation. You'll really need to give us hard evidence to prove what you are saying Of course. But we will keep destroying them because they are harmful! Why don't you update us about Covid 19 stats that is killing folks now, we will worry about 5G later, am sure you don't have scientific evidence for the sort of harm 5G has either... Is it right for a general worker at a private hospital to be sent to a public hospital when they have signs of contracting covid-19 which they picked up at work? Facts mus be followrd up with proof..

  You are 1/2 correct thousand already infected  which means mortality rate is provably lower than the seasonal flu.  This fear is insane and ignorant.     Don’t reply just wait and see.  COVID-19 is just like the flu.There are at least 4 coronavirus cases in the US that are not travel-related, officials say 11 new cases in San Antonio Texas. Let’s face it, there are thousands of cases in the United States right now that we are not even aware of. This is going to get really bad really fast.  You’re ignorant. I hope you don’t have any loved ones that are in the 15 to 18% mortality rate, which is anyone over the age of 80.  This is nowhere near equivalent to the flu.  It’s worse.

Even says 'Printed in Germany' on the bottom, a country that didn't exist at the time..  either way, if you step on those things you'd prefer death.  I LOVE THIS.Xxx  I, like most young boys, mostly built Lego dicks.Times may change but the truth of this Lego letter from the 1970s never has in 40 years   via   le genre de message à faire passer à la manif pour tous ... Sans illusions  [citation needed].“:Lego letter from the 1970s still offers a powerful message  _bhatt  so why the latest 'pink' lego for girls!? clearly fake. Employ someone to fact check yo. _ZW I think Minecraft gives same opportunities, now, as Lego...electronically	0

Flying around. No stream till Wednesday. Time to put the mask on! Any advice on how to stay aliveEveryone hates on the mask, f it mask off then. Jokes aside ot helps with not touching your face and also helps not spreading it if you got it yourself. Or so i have been told  It will actually protect you just as he says, by preventing you from touching your face and not getting the virus into your nose/mouth.  Didn't take the shortage into account. Better to keep your hands clean and spare the masks to those who need it.Ppl focus too much on the masks and not enough on keeping their hands clean.	0

So for those who are buying face masks.🙂Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. Tuskegee_RYS20So imma do a quick Coronavirus thread with facts and information since people seem like google ain’t free and because.....Tuskegee_RYS20 Should I wear a mask? People with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not need to wear a medical mask. WHO (World Health Organization) advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks. Tuskegee_RYS20Can I catch COVID-19 from my pets? Tuskegee_RYS20 Is it safe to recieve a package from where the virus has been reported? Yes. The chance of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching it from a package that travelled, and exposed to diff. conditions and temps is also low Tuskegee_RYS20 Is there anything I SHOULDNT DO? The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:-Smoking-Taking traditional herbal remedies-Wearing multiple masks-Taking self-medication such as antibiotics  Tuskegee_RYS20 Well that concludes my information session please use it.

"    What do you mean by “brought these issues to light”.Are you talking about press leaks, sticking it on a forum, a Tweet.Rangers went through the complaints system to the letter.Are you really suggesting Rangers should’ve breached confidentiality?Like giving vote results early.    He did, he was fobbed off, time &amp; again. Rangers complained about McLennan even being appointed. They also complained about Doncaster when he was previously made the subject of an enquiry in youth football, where he was accused of lying.This hasn’t popped up out of the blue.    ""He did, he was fobbed off, time &amp; again""Is there any actual proof to back up your claim here?    There may be in the minutes. You’ll have to ask the SPFL, specifically ND &amp; RM, why the minutes weren’t signed off for months.As it is, the reaction of Rangers satisfies me that they were getting fobbed off. That’s why we are where we are now.    The minutes should have been signed off, and any other concerns dealt with but it's absolutely bizarre that no one, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, brought these issues to light, until Dundee's vote got lost in the SPFL computer system.    No. I'm  saying he should have brought the issues up at the time. I think Rangers thought something dodgy went down when Dundee's vote was lost, came out shouting, and when it was shown to be a glitch in the system, Rangers have tried to justify their initial claim of corruption    Show me where Rangers claimed corruption. Point it out in a statement, in the dossier, or in an interview or on the website.You said it, back it up."	0
   My source, the WHO says what most public health experts sayCan the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the airAre the experts telling us it's going to be worse so, when it's not as bad, we are pleasantly surprised?Watch risk psychology expert  join  on last night's RealTime:    sadly, this guy was supposed to be an expert on risk and he was saying rather ignorantly that folks on planes and airplanes could be safe if they didn’t touch things but the virus is mostly airborne. that’s dangerously misleading at the most important time. stay say out there!    Yes, this is true, but how are respiratory droplets spread? People cough them into the air and then they move. Through the air. They literally spread in the air.    You guys are right that I was too unequivocal and imprecise. Particles do travel in the air. about 5-6 feet. Then they drop. Which is why all pub health officials say the main way the virus spreads is contact. Unless we're close together.	0

_rodman  No. World Health Organisation:How long does the virus survive on surfaces? This is unknown. It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces. Studies suggest that other coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus)....Please don't laugh at me, but I just found out I have a shipment of clothing from Hong Kong that was sent 7 days ago. Corona Virus lives on surfaces for 9 days. Should I wait to open it for two more days? Don’t open it. Use gloves and put it away. The reason that Coronavirus went stellar in Northern Italy was deliveries of fabric from China for the fashion industry. And I personally believe that the incubation period is up for debate...  You need to study epidemiology of viruses.  They cannot live outside of a host for an extended period.  Corona viruses cannot persist on a dry surface.  Your claims are unfounded and unscientific rumors designed to scare people.  That is completely unnecessary._rodman  World Health Organisation:...may live on surfaces from anything from a few hours up to several days. Some coronaviruses have survived between 7-9 days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).	0

"6/. So what is the logic behind easing lockdown early?Could it be the same logic that was behind the decisions not to screen at airports, not to ban public events in March, to delay lockdown etc.?The logic of HerdImmunity - of “taking it on the chin”!3/. “I think it's extraordinarily risky. I don’t think anyone could believe, from the scientific point of view, that this is a wise move.”Former CSA, Sir David King, thinks easing lockdown “too quickly"" makes the risk of a second wave ""very significant"". 4/. “Do you think the PM went against the will of his scientists?' “This is definitely a political decision.”_David_King.He points out that lifting lockdown too early doesn’t make sense from a scientific OR an economic perspective. 5/. Alok Sharma just told BBC that the govt has met it’s 5 tests &amp; that “we had almost 240,000 people tested on Monday”Yesterday,  said he didn’t have the data on how many people had been tested.The UK doesn’t have a digital test, trace, isolate system in place. 7/. Herdimmunity makes sense as an outcome NOT as a strategy...but on 12/3, briefed by No.10,  wrote: “The strategy of the govt is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so we acquire herd immunity.”Has this goal really changed? 8/. As well as costing hundreds of thousands of lives, HerdImmunity would depend on people developing immunity to COVID19, which is not certain.Antibodies don’t equal immunity &amp; immunity to other human coronaviruses (e.g SARS &amp; MERS) is only temporary.9/. The govt deny HerdImmunity was ever their strategy.Many think it was, until the 16 March when new data emerged.But UK lockdown was intended to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed rather than being part of a full suppression/elimination strategy. 10/. The UK govt isn’t all alone.Last month,  was asked if the US “just have to accept the idea that by reopening there will be more death?”“We have to be warriors. We can't keep our country closed down for years,” he replied. COVID19 11/. But the PM doesn’t talk of death. Instead he tells us “cautious optimism is palpable.”On 3 Feb, he was optimistic too, warning against “medically irrational” reactions to COVID19 that could “damage the economy.”Was this HerdImmunity strategy? 12/. Now is not the time for blame.It’s a time for honesty, for transparency and for unity.There are massive decisions facing our country in the coming months.We need sober leadship, responsible journalism &amp; for govt to listen to all our top scientists.HerdImmunityScandal 13/. Lack of transparency means little hard proof of HerdImmunity plans, but a leaked document shows on 23/3 Faculty – contracted with Palantir to build NHSX platform - proposed a simulation to assess the impact of “targeted herd immunity” (an oxymoron).14/.

Four months in, &amp; we still don’t know the govt’s objective.""Is the objective still to let coronavirus flow through the population &amp; just to stay within NHS capacity?""  asks. If so, that would explain the deadly HerdImmunity strategy!20/. In April, the govt changed the 5th test for easing lockdown from ""ensuring any adjustments will not risk a second peak” to ""adjustments will not overwhelm the NHS.""When _Hunt asked  why, he said: ""I'm not sure I can tell you"".21/. That Patrick Vallance &amp; no Minister has been able to tell us why this significant change was made, is extraordinary but unsurprising.But we don’t actually need them to explain.The answer is v clear.The govt is pursuing a HerdImmunity strategy.  22/. The fact the govt never diverted from the HerdImmunity strategy, makes the thinking behind their often inexplicable (in)actions, fall into place.The bewildering multiplicity of scandals are all part of one single scandal: the HerdImmunitScandal.23/. UK isn’t alone in attempting a HerdImmunity strategy.Sweden was open about it &amp; has a COVID19 mortality rate 7x higher than rest of EU with cases rising 16x faster.US &amp; Brazil have a policy of “opening the economy”.Dutch situation echoes UK.👇  24/. ONS figures released today show a slight increase in community transmission &amp; that the downward trend has levelled off. It shows only 1 in 1100 are estimated to be infected.Ystdy, US had the highest single-day total of new infections. BREAKING  We shouldn’t read too much into these figures.The study found  only 14 positive cases in 25,000 tests &amp; ONS says we ""don't have evidence that the current trend is anything other than flat"".I fear we are not in the ""dance phase"" but rather back on the ""mitigation"" trajectory. 26/. Asked by  why UK has the highest death rate in the world, _Rees_Mogg suggests it could be to with the weather.""Even things as simple as the weather may have influenced coronavirus has spread, &amp; so may the practices of individual cultures &amp; societies.” 27/. Asked how many people are be being tested per day,  said ystdy “We don’t have those data.”The govt haven’t released the figures for more than a month.Yet ministers seem happy to blurt out big numbers &amp; tell us how well the UK is doing. 28/. Italy’s health minister says  told Italy’s PM on 13/3 that “he wants herdimmunity.”On 12/ 3,  wrote: “The strategy of the govt is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity.”The govt didn’t correct him. 29/ The number of suspected coronavirus outbreaks in schools almost doubled last week, new Public Health England figures show.There number of “acute respiratory outbreaks” in schools rose from 24 to 44 – 16 more outbreaks than were recorded at hospitals.30/. The UK has moved from 4th from bottom to 24th from bottom of a global league in tackling coronavirus.The UK is now 155th out of 179 nations in the 2nd study by Oxford university’s Blavatnik School of GovtThe study looks at the WHO’s six tests.31/. This visual shows how, over 5 months from 1 Jan, Covid19 became more deadly than malaria (bigger killers eg heart disease, stroke etc aren’t included)COVID cases are rising:Today’s figures9.8m cases480K deaths(By Tony Nickonchur &amp; Gavin Wood)UK hardest hit of all G7 nations in the weeks leading up to early June, according to BBC.England fared the worst in Europe, just above Spain. The research compared 11-week periods for each nation as the virus hit its peak in each country.   33/. Up to 90% of new cases at local level are missing from the govt dataThis means that the public - school governors, local businesses, journalists writing about the presence or absence of new outbreaks etc - are being deliberately fed misleading data34/. It wasn’t Data Protection stopping testing info going to councils. The requirement wasn’t in the contract!""The contract with Deloitte doesn’t require the company to report positive cases to PHE &amp; local authorities."" email to  via  ""He covers up crime with scandal &amp; covers up malice with incompetence. They want to project an image of being inept, instead of as having a cruel &amp; well-defined plan.”  on Trump’s admin.Sound familiar?All part of HerdImmunityScandal.  36/. Failure to publish Pillar 2 data (public test results) &amp; then covering it up is a scandalStarmer says a week was lost b/c the local authority didn’t have the right data claims Pillar 1 &amp; 2 data was sharedThe Mayor of Leicester only got it on Thursday PMQs  Yes! Not enough have died And yet there is still no proof, as far as i'm aware, that having the virus gives you immunity for anything more than a few months. Within this context any ""herd immunity"" policy is more like state sanctioned murder, no? No, it's the simple logic that there would be catastrophic economic damage if it continued for much longer. Easing it early? Are you actually being serious? People have been locked away for three months for gods sake...why not have a discussion about the growing mental health issue in this country because of it? Or is it ok for teenagers to kill themselves? You won’t reply obviously"	0

"Breaking News: Pope Francis’ encounter with Kim Davis wasn’t an endorsement of her views, the Vatican says. Tactician. Figured that, the douchebag Pope wouldn't actually follow the Bible, its not to his liking. Then why did he feel the need to meet with her? Sure. He just chose her at random. Could have been you or me. yea, right. this is breaking news?. The meeting was unfortunate nonetheless. Why did  even give her the time of day? Did he also meet with ?. And it appears not to be much of an encounter. Davis with the Warhol Clock running down... Why did he include veiled follow up remarks during flight home?  damage control, but the damage is done. Very disappointed. It shouldn't have happened at all.  Backtracking bullshit this morning!  If the WH were spinning this damage control they would've said Kim Davis was needing counsel about entering into her 5th marriage.   Liar. Coward. Hypocrite. who cares iam sick if this Kim Davis woman getting attention ... yes I respect her belief but move on Kim Davis appears to have exploited people her entire life.She apparently thrives off of hurting people, even  Slap in face to gays. I have doubt with this Pope .. I don't know, very confusing Pope ever ! ""I forsay character lies"" Good Digginns The Fastest Land Acts Were The Break Throughs OfClean Spirit This is why 'Religiosity' sucks! They can't just take a stand. They have to play to the gallery.  apparently once you're sufficiently holy it's totes OK to be wildly dishonest your idea of what is important and is breaking news is really off. Not trending. ok to endorse religious beliefs; not ok to wield beliefs to support punishment of non believers! --A new spin; to stay politically correct, I suppose. Prior reports have him supporting her bigoted actions. Like Catholic church.  They are saying the meeting wasn't private, she was  in a group of people and the Pope was not aware of her situation. Ummm… doesn't matter. That 15 minute meeting pissed away his credibility with damn near everyone who isn't a against this non-issue.. To be clear, Pope Francis did not have spiritual relations with that woman.  Bigger slap to the Catholics! Could'nt he find any doing God's work? He chose to bless Born Again before Catholic, SAD!"	0
 My neighbor, a committed Trumper, told me the cornoravirus [COVID-19] is just like the flu; nothing to worry about. Trump and his enablers have deluded millions of our fellow Americans. DumpTrump2020If you were going to make up mocking, parody screenshots of Fox News shows, they’d look exactly like these.  Two more friends, Trumpers both, just told me that’s it’s just like the flu and told me to stop with the fear mongering.	1
     cool, good thing surgical and cloths masks don’t cause significant hypoxia! ❤️“The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency.”     I'm curious...can you provide proof that masks don't work? As mentioned, medical professionals can and do wear them for hours. So if you're having surgery, you'd be ok with the doctor NOT wearing a mask while standing over your open, susceptible body? God forbid he sneezes.     😍🥰research!!!😍🥰😍“Conclusion:The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic.”	0

 _Wood1 What is the goal of a vaccine? You guessed it. Herd immunity! Not everyone can take a vaccine. People used to have measle and chicken pox parties to get it over with. I’m not saying covid is the same disease but this idea you have to hide until there’s a vaccine is moronic  That's just plain not true. We're not declining as a whole around the country but are holding fairly steady as some states improve but others get worse. And I notice you conveniently ignored all of the data I shared providing context to your first graph._Wood1  I didn’t ignore anything. Arguing on social media solves nothing. You’ll have your opinion no matter what I share._Wood1  The fact of the matter is the general population of 18 to 50 that is relatively healthy is going to need to be exposed to Covid. It’s called developing heard immunity. Hiding in your house from the virus like it’s a cat burglar does not work. I’m not saying not to wear your mask. _Wood1 This is false. The vaccine will create immunity as they have for other communicable diseases. There is no need to risk people’s lives until the vaccine because you don’t like a mask. _Wood1 You’d rather knowingly let people die to achieve a goal that we will achieve in 6 months without the unnecessary deaths... WAIT FOR IT... so you don’t have to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth sometimes...Bless your heart. Good bye	0

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2What is a coronavirus?Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3How does COVID-19 spread?People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 1/3These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2	0
"From WHO: ""Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?*Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air."" The above info is from the WHO whatsapp link below, a few minutes ago. This too though, on March 16:""The everyday person shouldn’t be concerned, Van Kerkhove said, but medical staff may be susceptible when performing procedures such as intubation — where a tube is placed down a patient’s throat and into their airway to assist with breathing."" NeJM  Good info. Thanks. Saw this morning:  yes it is the official advise that i was questioning. however on reading this very comprehensive article i just found on the issue, i think it is indeed sound and this is the study btw which i was referring to(from the same article). i first heard about it from Reuters  Covid-19 is mRNA virus disease and quite similar to SARS virus. Apart from respiratory droplets infections, this virus has got other high infectious properties. It can enter your body through nose, eyes, mouth hence social distancing and regular hand wash is very important. What if droplets from an infected persons sneeze are floating in the air?The problem here is because this is a new virus, there are  many contradictory messages floating around. Like, those without symptoms need not wear a mask. But, many infected persons dont have symptoms."	0

Interesting new study on COVID19 immunity. If results hold, twice as many have had the infection vs what is visible from antibody tests. How long does this T-cell immunity last? If as long as antibody, we might be closer to herd immunity than thought. Another interesting consequence would be that the mortality rate has been overestimated and can be cut to half, approximately 0.3% instead of 0.6% according swedish data	0

US tried reopening and Covid cases seem to be spiking again. Flu season is 6 months away. So what is the end game? Vaccine is still down the line. Herd immunity? Large complicated democracies had no chance against the virus. Like it or not, it will end up at herd immunity. Clear evidence of only two type of countries being able to eliminate this - strong willed small countries like NZ or autocracy like China._Kumar_15  I guess as long as mortality rate is less than half a percent (seems like that if one goes by the antibody testing method)...might just be one more disease?	0

" That's where we can agree my Right Honorable Gentleman! lol When u have a number of high draft picks on your D-Line you should expect results, especially now adding some say was the best player in the draft. Unfair? Sure. But life unfortunately is unfair so we have to deal w/ it. Help? lol They didn't draft him 2 to ""help"" but dominate the defense!!! Which most of the analysts, besides you, agree that he is a once in lifetime draft pick and a game changer. Right. That means the defense needs to be excellent for them to be correct. WHen the D is not excellent, I will be proven 100% correct. He is really good. The defense will not be. I of course disagree with you about the defense with Jack Del Rio as D-Coordinator,  as well as how the offense will perform. This isn't the Redskins of the past few years Danny! Recognize! I recognize that a new DC means so much more than 1 player on that side of the ball ever could. I also recognize that the expectations that this group is now elite is unfair &amp; near impossible to reach Well put. Thanks Danny, I appreciate that.

YOU DID NOT SPEAK ON THE SHOOTING IN CHICAGO WHY? CAUSE IT WOULD THROW THE MAYOR UNDER THE BUS AND THAT'S YOUR FRIENDS.ANOTHER VIDEO.. has anyone else noticed mass shootings skyrocketted in the Obama years? Q for those who think guns are the problem.  What, specifically, do you propose and how would that have prevented this event.  Thanks. can he please just the hell up! so true - NOT NEAR  ENOUGH He right ! Obama doesn't give a F about America! He has done everything to weaken our Country! He needs to be Impeached for Treason! If that's true. then the problem is beyond help. And yet he keeps talking, non-stop. he's such a buffoon.  Did he speak out when some thugs shot 16 at a new Orleans park not long ago? for sure. New times, new laws.  Time to kick ass Obama.If not you will be forever in thoughts and prayers.

   Joseph Smith, who translated it by the Gift &amp; power of God. Not to come forth until our Generation to be another testament of Jesus ChristWe need it for our dayThe Catholics would have needed to know a book was written in the Americas to add it to the Bible they compiled   It was available then, since Lehi Left Jerusalem 600 years BC. Fled to the wilderness &amp; latter came over to the Americas, had old testament writings &amp; taught their families. Wrote their own journals/histories. Was hidden in the ground by the direction of God &amp; given to Joseph...   Even though the message from the Bible isn't perfect, it is still the word of God &amp; testifies of our lord &amp; Saviour, Jesus Christ &amp; the only way to God is through our Saviour, by his Grace alone. We never said we can make it to Heaven by our worksBut Good Works are of God   I believe as do all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints, that we are saved by Grace, just like youBookofMormon has one translation, by the Gift &amp; power of God, a companion to the Bible to help clarify &amp; teach of Christ, his love, Atonement &amp; other sheep    It’s an insult to God almighty to not take Him at his word. Jesus said “It Is Finished”. There is no other testament of Christ.    Jesus was talking about the Atonement when he said that on the cross.If he meant the Bible, not around then. Bible would've been completed way before Revelations. Revelations was chronologically written many books before the end of the Bible, so all those books don't count?	0
